## Overview

Optimism's documentation is open-source and hosted on GitHub in the `ethereum-optimism/docs` repository. The documentation is rendered at [docs.optimism.io](https://docs.optimism.io). You can contribute either by:
- Forking the `docs` repository and working locally
- Using the "Suggest edits" button on any documentation page for smaller updates

All contributions, pull requests, and issues should be in English at this time. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with Markdown
- Understanding of technical documentation principles
- Node.js and npm installed

### Development Setup
1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start development server
4. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can now start changing content and see the website updated live each time you save a new file. 🤓

## Contributing Process

### File Architecture

See the [mintlify docs](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/organize/navigation).

**Warning**: The `public` folder contains `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for SEO purposes. These files are maintained by the Documentation team only.

### Content Guidelines
We use [mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/docs) to power our docs.

Please refer to our comprehensive [Style Guide](/reference/contribute/style-guide) for detailed formatting instructions.

### Local Testing

Follow these [docs](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/installation) for local changes.

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
- Fix any reported issues
- Verify content accuracy
- Test all links and references
- Target the `mintlify` branch (`main` needs to be cleaned up)

### Submission Guidelines
1. Create a [new pull request](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/new/choose)
2. Choose appropriate PR type or use blank template
3. Provide clear title and accurate description
4. Add labels

> **Important**: Add `flag:merge-pending-release` label if the PR content should only be released publicly in sync with a product release.

> **Tip**: Use "[Create draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)" if your work is still in progress.

### Review Process
1. Assignment to Documentation team member
2. Technical review for accuracy
3. Quality and scope alignment check
4. Minimum 1 reviewer approval required
5. Reviewers will either approve, request changes, or close the pull request with comments
6. Automatic deployment after merge to [docs.optimism.io](https://docs.optimism.io)
