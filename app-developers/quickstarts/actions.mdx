<Warning>Actions SDK is still under construction and not ready for production use! This guide is meant for early testing purposes only.</Warning>

The [Actions SDK](https://actions.money/) is an opensource Typescript development toolkit that simplifies the act of integrating DeFi into your application.

## How it works

Here's a breakdown of what's under the hood:

- **Modular Providers**: Actions is built with a set of core adapters called "Providers". Providers let you to pick an choose the right services and protocols for your use-case.

- **Embedded Wallets**: Actions supports popular embedded [wallet providers](https://actions.money/#wallet), allowing your users to access DeFi with email authentication flows alone.

- **Configure your own Actions**: Extent your embedded wallet with DeFi actions like Lend, Borrow, Swap, and Pay. Set multiple providers for each Action to choose the best markets.

- **Customize your assets and chains**: Allow and block assets, markets, chains, and protocols from your application from a single config.
