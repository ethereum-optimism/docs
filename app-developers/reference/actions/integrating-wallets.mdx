## Which wallets are right for my use case?

In order to let your users access DeFi, they will need an <Tooltip tip="Ethereum Virtual Machine" cta="Learn more" href="https://ethereum.org/wallets/">EVM</Tooltip>-compatible wallet. There are plenty of considerations when selecting a wallet schema that works for you:

- Who will maintain custody of funds?
- What permissions must exist for my use case?
- Where in my stack should transaction signatures originate?
- How can my users on and off ramp funds?

Actions SDK supports popular [embedded wallet providers](#embedded-wallet-providers) to address all of these questions while remaining flexible to your use case.

## Embedded Wallet Providers

Embedded wallet providers give your users the ability to sign onchain transactions through your app's existing email authentication and authorization flows.

Actions works with:

## Gas Sponsorship

Signing and sending onchain transactions requires fees payment in the form of as "gas", which adds [additional overhead](/app-developers/guides/transactions/estimates) for you and friction for users.

## Connect your wallet to Actions

Regardless of where and how transactions are signed, Actions has you covered.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a wallet provider">
    Follow embedded wallet provider documentation and installation steps.
    Actions works with Typescript clients, both frontend React and backend Node.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Actions SDK">
    Import [Actions SDK](https://actions.money/) alongside your chosen wallet
    provider SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and fetch embedded user wallets">
    Follow embedded wallet provider documentation for wallet creation and
    access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass the wallet to Actions">
    When it's time to Lend, Borrow, Swap, or Pay, call `toActionsWallet(...)`,
    and pass in the provider wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">Once</Step>
</Steps>

See [Actions Quickstart Guide](/app-developers/quickstarts/actions) for sample code for all supported wallet providers.

## Smart wallets & signers

In addition to using embedded wallet providers natively, Actions supports the creation of custom smart contract wallets.
