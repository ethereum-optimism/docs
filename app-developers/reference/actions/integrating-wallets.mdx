## Which wallets are right for my use case?

In order to let your users access DeFi, they will need an <Tooltip tip="Ethereum Virtual Machine" cta="Learn more" href="https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</Tooltip>-compatible wallet. There are plenty of considerations when selecting a wallet schema that works for you:

- Who will maintain custody of funds?
- What permissions must exist for my use case?
- Where in my stack should transaction signatures originate?
- How can my users on and off ramp funds?

Actions SDK supports popular [embedded wallet providers](#embedded-wallet-providers) to address all of these questions while remaining flexible to your use case.

## Embedded Wallet Providers

Embedded wallet providers give your users the ability to sign onchain transactions through your app's existing email authentication and authorization flows.

Actions works with:

## Gas Sponsorship

Signing and sending onchain transactions requires gas, or fee payment, which adds [additional overhead](/app-developers/guides/transactions/estimates) for you and friction for users.

Actions supports gas sponsorship via a combination of smart contract wallets and [paymasters](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677). First, configure a paymaster in the chain config by specifying a bundler url. Now, any transactions submitted via an actions SmartWallet on that chain will automatically use your paymaster, therefore eliminating the need for the wallet to pay gas.

## Connect your wallet to Actions

Regardless of where and how transactions are signed, Actions has you covered.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a wallet provider">
    Follow embedded wallet provider documentation and installation steps.
    Actions works with Typescript clients, both frontend React and backend Node.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Actions SDK">
    Import [Actions SDK](https://actions.money/) alongside your chosen wallet
    provider SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and fetch embedded user wallets">
    Follow embedded wallet provider documentation for wallet creation and
    access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass the wallet to Actions">
    Call `actions.wallet.toActionsWallet(...)`, and [pass
    in](/app-developers/quickstarts/actions#choose-a-wallet-provider) the
    provider wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    The returned [Wallet
    ](/app-developers/reference/actions/integrating-wallets#wallet-instance) is
    now capable of calling Actions
    [functions](/app-developers/quickstarts/actions#take-action) like Lend,
    Borrow, Swap and Pay!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Smart wallets & signers

In addition to using embedded provider wallets directly, Actions [supports the creation](/app-developers/quickstarts/actions#choose-a-wallet-provider) of custom smart contract wallets. This additional wallet type is separate from, but still controlled by the owner of the embedded wallet.

If you [configure it](/app-developers/guides/configuring-actions), Actions will deploy a [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compliant [Coinbase Smart Wallets](https://github.com/coinbase/smart-wallet) on the chains you've chosen to support.

Once created, an embedded wallet can be added as a signer on the smart wallet, capable of signing transactions on behalf of the Smart Wallet.

See [Wallet Documentation](/app-developers/reference/actions/wallet-definitions) for additional details.
