The following guide lists platforms you can use to gather analytics and setup customizations about OP Mainnet.

## Blocknative

[Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/) lets you [decode](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api) and [analyze](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive) OP Stack Batches submitted to the Ethereum L1. You can inspect, analyze, decode, and download the data of any batch – confirmed on-chain or not – via public APIs or visually through the [Ethernow Explorer](http://ethernow.xyz). Below you can find links to the different resources:

*   [Batch Decoding API](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api): decode OP Stack Batch transactions into its human-readable, JSON format.
*   [Blob Archive API](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive): take any versioned hash of an OP Stack Blob and receive the blob data (even beyond the 4096 epoch window of storage).
*   [Mempool Archive](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/mempool-archive): Analyze any OP Stack transaction that was in the Ethereum mempool to see detection time, time pending, gas, etc.
*   [Ethernow explorer](http://ethernow.xyz): Visually see transactions and batches enter the mempool and get organized into blocks. Use this filter to see OP Stack Batches enter the mempool and land on-chain.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) provides comprehensive monitoring and security solutions for OP-powered Chains, allowing you to stay informed and respond proactively to potential issues in real time.

*   Configure [Tenderly Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) for monitoring wallets and setting up real-time notifications on transactions and contract events. Notifications trigger external webhooks, PagerDuty, or chat apps like Telegram and Slack.
*   Rely on [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to monitor and analyze transaction execution with high level of details.
*   Use [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to automate predefined responses, improving security and user experience.
*   Integrate [Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to predict transaction outcomes such as the expected asset changes, precise gas usage, and emitted events.

## Dune analytics

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com) allows anyone to create dashboards that present information about OP Chains (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora are available). See [Dune Docs](https://dune.com/docs/) for more info.
You can find a list of community created dashboards for OP Chains [here](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=tags%3Aop%2Coptimism%2Csuperchain\&order=trending\&time_range=24h), or [create your own](https://docs.dune.com/#queries) dashboard.

Here are some of our favorite dashboards so far:

*   [OP Chains / Superchain - L2 Activity, Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity)
*   [OP Chains / Superchain - Popular Apps & Project Usage Trends](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-op-chains-apps-and-project-usage-trends)
*   [By OP Chain - L2/L1 Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-l2-l1-economics)
*   [OP Token House Delegates](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house)
*   [Superchain NFTs](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-nfts)

### Build on Optimism with Sim APIs and Sim IDX

[Dune](https://dune.com/home), the onchain data platform trusted by top protocols is now available to build your application on Optimism. Dune's developer platform, Sim, gives you direct access to the same high-quality, real-time data that developers and analysts have come to rely on. Whether you need immediate access to decoded data via REST APIs with Sim APIs or the ability to create your own indexers with Sim IDX, you can now bring real-time onchain data into your apps.

Sim APIs offer a fast way to query a wide range of onchain information from Optimism and dozens of other networks through a suite of straightforward endpoints:

* [**Activity API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity)**:** Get a complete, real-time feed of wallet activity, from simple transfers to decoded contract interactions.  
* [**Balances API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/balances)**:** Retrieve live native and ERC20 token balances, complete with metadata, USD valuations, and historical point-in-time prices.  
* [**Collectibles API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/collectibles)**:** Fetch all NFT (ERC721 and ERC1155) balances and their associated metadata for any address.  
* [**Transactions API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/transactions)**:** Access granular details for transactions, including block information, gas data, and decoded transaction call data and event logs.  
* [**Token Info API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/token-info)**:** Look up detailed metadata and pricing for any native asset or ERC20 token, including historical point-in-time prices.  
* [**Token Holders API**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/token-holders)**:** Discover the full token distribution for any ERC20 or ERC721 token, ranked by wallet value.

For use cases that require specific onchain data not available through Sim APIs, Sim IDX provides a framework to build and deploy your own indexers. You can define your indexing logic entirely in Solidity, giving you granular control to capture any event or function call from any smart contract on Optimism and dozens of other supported chains.

* [**Write Indexers in Solidity**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/idx/listener)**:** Use your existing smart contract skills to define exactly what onchain data you need, from simple event logs to complex state changes.  
* [**Fully Managed Infrastructure**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/idx)**:** Sim IDX handles the entire indexing pipeline, including node management, data storage, historical backfilling, and a production-ready database.  
* [**Build Once, Deploy Across Multiple Chains**](https://docs.sim.dune.com/idx/deployment)**:** Write a single listener contract and deploy it to index data from Optimism and any other supported EVM network.

With this combination, Optimism developers have a complete toolkit to build new onchain apps. Use [Sim APIs](https://docs.sim.dune.com/) for immediate access to rich, decoded data, or use [Sim IDX](https://docs.sim.dune.com/idx) to create specialized indexers tailored to your app's unique data requirements. This enables you to enhance everything from advanced wallets and dApps to sophisticated analytical tools by using Dune's real-time data infrastructure directly on the Optimism network.
