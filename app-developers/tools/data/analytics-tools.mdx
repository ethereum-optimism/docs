The following guide lists platforms you can use to gather analytics and setup customizations about OP Mainnet.

## GoldRush (powered by Covalent)

GoldRush (powered by Covalent) offers the most comprehensive Blockchain Data API suite for developers, analysts, and enterprises. Whether you are building a DeFi dashboard, a wallet, a trading bot, an AI agent or a compliance platform, the Data APIs provide fast, accurate, and developer-friendly access to the essential on-chain data you need. 

GoldRush consists of the following self-serve products that can be used independently or together to power your application:

| **Product Name** | **Description** | **Key Data Feeds** | **Use Cases** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Foundational API** | Access structured historical blockchain data across 100+ chains via REST APIs | <ul><li>Token balances (spot & historical)</li><li>Token transfers</li><li>Token holders (spot & historical)</li><li>Token prices (onchain)</li><li>Wallet transactions</li><li>Get logs</li></ul> |<ul><li>Wallets</li><li>Portfolio trackers</li><li>Crypto accounting & tax tools</li><li>DeFi dashboards</li><li>Activity feeds</li></ul> |
| **Streaming API** | Subscribe to real-time blockchain events with sub-second latency using GraphQL over WebSockets | <ul><li>OHLCV tokens & pairs</li><li>New & updated DEX pairs</li><li>Wallet activity</li><li>Token balances</li></ul> | <ul><li>Trading dashboards</li><li>Sniper bots</li><li>Gaming</li><li>Agentic workflows</li></ul> |


The **[GoldRush TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@covalenthq/client-sdk)** is the fastest way to integrate the GoldRush APIs. Install with:

```bash
npm install @covalenthq/client-sdk
```

## Blocknative

[Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/) lets you [decode](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api) and [analyze](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive) OP Stack Batches submitted to the Ethereum L1. You can inspect, analyze, decode, and download the data of any batch – confirmed on-chain or not – via public APIs or visually through the [Ethernow Explorer](http://ethernow.xyz). Below you can find links to the different resources:

*   [Batch Decoding API](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api): decode OP Stack Batch transactions into its human-readable, JSON format.
*   [Blob Archive API](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive): take any versioned hash of an OP Stack Blob and receive the blob data (even beyond the 4096 epoch window of storage).
*   [Mempool Archive](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/mempool-archive): Analyze any OP Stack transaction that was in the Ethereum mempool to see detection time, time pending, gas, etc.
*   [Ethernow explorer](http://ethernow.xyz): Visually see transactions and batches enter the mempool and get organized into blocks. Use this filter to see OP Stack Batches enter the mempool and land on-chain.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) provides comprehensive monitoring and security solutions for OP-powered Chains, allowing you to stay informed and respond proactively to potential issues in real time.

*   Configure [Tenderly Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) for monitoring wallets and setting up real-time notifications on transactions and contract events. Notifications trigger external webhooks, PagerDuty, or chat apps like Telegram and Slack.
*   Rely on [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to monitor and analyze transaction execution with high level of details.
*   Use [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to automate predefined responses, improving security and user experience.
*   Integrate [Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to predict transaction outcomes such as the expected asset changes, precise gas usage, and emitted events.

## Dune analytics

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com) allows anyone to create dashboards that present information about OP Chains (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora are available). See [Dune Docs](https://dune.com/docs/) for more info.
You can find a list of community created dashboards for OP Chains [here](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=tags%3Aop%2Coptimism%2Csuperchain\&order=trending\&time_range=24h), or [create your own](https://docs.dune.com/#queries) dashboard.

For developers building apps on OP chains, Dune's developer platform, [Sim](https://sim.dune.com/), provides real-time onchain data access via [Sim APIs](https://docs.sim.dune.com/) and custom indexing with [Sim IDX](https://docs.sim.dune.com/idx).

Here are some of our favorite dashboards so far:

*   [OP Chains / Superchain - L2 Activity, Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity)
*   [OP Chains / Superchain - Popular Apps & Project Usage Trends](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-op-chains-apps-and-project-usage-trends)
*   [By OP Chain - L2/L1 Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-l2-l1-economics)
*   [OP Token House Delegates](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house)
*   [Superchain NFTs](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-nfts)
