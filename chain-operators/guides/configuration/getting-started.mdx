title: Chain Operator Configurations
description: Learn the how to configure an OP Stack chain.
---

OP Stack chains can be configured for the Chain Operator's needs. Each  
component of the stack has its own considerations. See the following for 
documentation for details on configuring each piece.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Rollup Configuration">
Deploying your OP Stack contracts requires creating a deployment configuration
  JSON file. This defines the behavior of your network at its genesis.
  *   **Important Notes:**
      *   The Rollup Configuration sets parameters for the L1 smart contracts upon deployment. These parameters govern the behavior of your chain and are critical to its operation.
      *   Be aware that many of these values cannot be changed after deployment or require a complex process to update.
          Carefully consider and validate all settings during configuration to avoid issues later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Batcher Configuration">
The batcher is the service that submits the L2 Sequencer data to L1, to make
  it available for verifiers. These configurations determine the batcher's 
  behavior.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Proposer Configuration">
The proposer is the service that submits the output roots to the L1. These
  configurations determine the proposer's behavior.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Node Configuration">
The rollup node has a wide array of configurations for both the consensus and
  execution clients.
