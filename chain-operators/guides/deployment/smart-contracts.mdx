# Overview

This guide outlines the process for deploying the OP Stack L1 smart contracts using `op-deployer`.

Deploying OP Stack L1 contracts is the first step in spinning up your rollup.

<Info>
  For a standard version of the OP Stack, always deploy from an official contract release tag, which have been approved by Optimism Governance. 
  This is especially important for chains that intend to join the Superchain. 
  You can find these in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/validation/standard).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Contract changes are generally not considered backwards compatible.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install op-deployer">
  First, install the `op-deployer` tool following the [installation instructions](/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an intent file">
  Generate an intent file that defines your chain configuration:
  
    ```bash
    op-deployer init \
      --l1-chain-id <chain ID of your L1> \
      --l2-chain-ids <comma-separated list of chain IDs for your L2s> \
      --workdir .deployer \
      --intent-type <standard|custom|standard-overrides>
    ```
  
    Customize the generated intent file according to your requirements. See the [op-deployer configuration guide](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#understanding-the-intenttoml-fields) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy the contracts">
  Execute the deployment:
  
    ```bash
    op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer --l1-rpc-url <rpc-url> --private-key <private key hex>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify contract source code (Optional)">
  Verify your deployed contracts on block explorers:
  
    ```bash
    op-deployer verify \
      --l1-rpc-url <l1 rpc url> \
      --etherscan-api-key <your free etherscan api key>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate chain configuration files">
  Generate the necessary configuration files for your L2 node:
  
    ```bash
    op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/genesis.json
    op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/rollup.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
