title: Set the Minimum Base Fee
description: Learn how to set a minimum base fee on your OP-Stack Chain
---

## Overview

| Parameter | Type | Default | Recommended | Max Allowed for Standard Chains | Units |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| <code>minBaseFee</code> | Number | 0 (disabled) | 100,000 | 10,000,000,000 | wei |

The <strong>Minimum Base Fee</strong> (`minBaseFee`) configuration was introduced in the <strong>[Jovian hardfork](https://docs.optimism.io/notices/upgrade-17)</strong>. 
This feature allows chain operators to specify a minimum L2 base fee to which can help avoid excessively long priority fee auctions that can occur when the base fee falls too low.

When [batcher-sequencer throttling is active](https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/guides/configuration/batcher#batcher-sequencer-throttling) for long enough and the minBaseFee isn't enabled (or is zero), the base fee can drop all the way down to 1 wei. It can take a long time to recover back to a stable base fee.


The steps below explain how to update the `minBaseFee` parameter on-chain using the <code>SystemConfig</code> contract.

<Warning>
  Setting the `minBaseFee` too high may make transactions harder to include for users.
</Warning>


## How to Update the Minimum Base Fee

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your SystemConfig contract address">
    The [SystemConfig](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/system-config.html) contract stores configurable protocol parameters such as gas limits and fee settings.  
    You can find its proxy address in the [state.json generated by op-deployer](https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/op-deployer-setup#deploy-l1-contracts).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Call the setMinimumBaseFee() method">
   <Info>
    Note that the owner of the `SystemConfig` contract is the [System Config Owner address](/op-stack/protocol/privileged-roles), so this transaction must be sent from that address.
    </Info>
    To update the minimum base fee, call the following method on the `SystemConfig` contract:

    `setMinBaseFee(uint64 minBaseFee) external onlyOwner;`
   
    Example (using [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/reference/cast/)):

    ```bash title="cast"
    cast send <SYSTEM_CONFIG_PROXY_ADDRESS> "setMinBaseFee(uint64)" 100000 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the new value">
    After the transaction confirms, verify the current value by calling the following getter method on the `SystemConfig` contract:
    
    `function minBaseFee() external view returns (uint64);`

    Example (using [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/reference/cast/)):

    ```bash title="cast"
    cast call <SYSTEM_CONFIG_PROXY_ADDRESS> "minBaseFee()"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
