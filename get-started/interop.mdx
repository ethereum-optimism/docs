# Superchain Interoperability

Superchain interoperability is the next major scalability improvement to the OP Stack which enables a network of chains, the Superchain, to feel like a single blockchain. This revolutionary approach unlocks 1-block latency and trust-minimized cross-chain composability.

## What is Superchain Interoperability?

Superchain interoperability enables:

*   **Native asset transfers**: ETH and ERC-20 tokens move securely between chains via native minting and burning
*   **Cross-chain composability**: Smart contracts can compose with data across multiple chains
*   **Horizontal scalability**: Applications can scale across multiple chains seamlessly
