---

The OP Stack is the standardized, shared, and open-source development stack that powers Optimism and makes it easy to spin up your own production-ready Layer 2 blockchain. Whether you're building applications or deploying your own chain, the OP Stack provides the foundation you need.

## What is the OP Stack?

The OP Stack is a modular collection of software components that work together to create Layer 2 blockchains. It includes:

- **Execution Layer**: Processes transactions and manages state
- **Consensus Layer**: Handles block production and validation
- **Data Availability**: Ensures transaction data is available
- **Settlement Layer**: Finalizes transactions on Ethereum
