# Superchain Overview

The Superchain is a network of OP Stack chains that share a unified bridging protocol, governance system, and development stack. It represents the next evolution of Layer 2 scaling, creating a cohesive ecosystem where chains can interoperate seamlessly.

## What is the Superchain?

The Superchain is more than just a collection of blockchainsâ€”it's a unified network that enables:

*   **Shared Security**: All chains inherit security from Ethereum
*   **Native Interoperability**: Chains can communicate with minimal latency
*   **Unified Governance**: Coordinated upgrades and standards
*   **Developer Experience**: Consistent tooling across all chains
