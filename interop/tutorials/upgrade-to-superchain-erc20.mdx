  The SuperchainERC20 standard is ready for production deployments.
  Please note that the OP Stack interoperability upgrade, required for crosschain messaging, is currently still in active development.

## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade an ERC20 to a [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) that can teleport across the [Superchain interop cluster](/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster) using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract. For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/interop/superchain-erc20).


There are several ways to upgrade an existing ERC20 for interop, depending on your circumstances:


| When To Use                                                 | Action                                                                                                                    |
