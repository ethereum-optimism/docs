title: Using snap sync for node operators
description: Learn how to use and enable snap sync on your node.

This guide shows you how to enable and configure Snap Sync for your node. For an overview of how snap sync works and its benefits, see the [Snap Sync feature page](/node-operators/reference/features/snap-sync).

## Enable snap sync for your node

<Info>
For snap sync, all `op-geth` nodes should expose port `30303` TCP and `30303` UDP to easily find other op-geth nodes to sync from.
  *   If you set the port with [`--discovery.port`](/node-operators/guides/execution-config#discoveryport), then you must open the port specified for UDP.
  *   If you set [`--port`](/node-operators/guides/execution-config#port), then you must open the port specified for TCP.
  *   The only exception is for sequencers and transaction ingress nodes.
</Info>

Snap sync requires no datadir on OP Mainnet. With snap sync, `op-node` tells the execution client to snap sync, and then the execution client downloads the state at tip and once complete switches to inserting blocks one by one.

### Configuration for op-node

```shell
--syncmode=execution-layer
```

<Info>
  The `--syncmode=execution-layer` flag is not the default setting and must be explicitly configured.
</Info>

### Configuration for op-geth

```shell
--syncmode=snap
```

<Info>
  The `--syncmode=snap` flag is the default setting for `op-geth`.
</Info>

### Configuration for Nethermind

```shell
--config op-mainnet
--Sync.SnapSync=true
```

<Warning>
  A single restart of `Nethermind` during Snap Sync may extend the sync time by up to 2 hours because `Nethermind` has to rebuild the caches by reading millions of values from the database.
</Warning>

## Enabling execution layer sync for alternative clients

In addition to `op-geth` and `Nethermind`, you can enable execution-layer syncing with alternative execution clients such as `reth` and `op-erigon`.

Unlike `op-geth` and `Nethermind`, `reth` and `op-erigon` are designed as archive nodes, which means they require the complete history of the chain.
However, these clients can still retrieve block headers and data through the P2P network instead of deriving each individual block, resulting in a faster initial sync.

For OP Mainnet, the [bedrock datadir](/operators/node-operators/management/snapshots) is required. For other OP Stack networks, no datadir is required.

### Configuration for reth

```shell
--syncmode=execution-layer
--l2.enginekind=reth
```

<Info>
  Both flags are not the default setting and must be explicitly configured.
</Info>

### Configuration for op-erigon

```shell
--syncmode=execution-layer
--l2.enginekind=erigon
```

<Info>
  Both flags are not the default setting and must be explicitly configured.
</Info>
