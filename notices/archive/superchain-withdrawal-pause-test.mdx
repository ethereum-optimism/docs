</Info>

The Optimism Collective will be testing improved incident response features on the Sepolia Superchain.

## What's happening

1.  During this exercise, the privileged [`GUARDIAN`](/op-stack/protocol/privileged-roles#guardian) address will call the `pause` function on the `SuperchainConfig`.
2.  Members of the Optimism Collective's security team will ensure that the pause is executed correctly and the incident response improvements worked as intended.
3.  Then the `unpause` function will be called to resume normal operations.

To learn more about this functionality, please refer to this [documentation](/stack/security/pause).

This functionality is important for the security of the Superchain and should be understood by Chain Operators, users, and especially for centralized exchanges and third-party bridge operators. **Please note that this will not affect any L1-to-L2 deposit transactions or L2 transactions. No action is required from users or operators.**
