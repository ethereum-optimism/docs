title: Upgrade 17 - Jovian Hard Fork
description: Learn how to prepare for the Jovian hard fork
---

The Jovian hardfork is a proposed network upgrade for OP Stack chains, which brings several improvements to the way rollup fees are calculated as well as performing a maintenance update to the fault proof virtual machine.

<Info>
  Jovian activation times are: **Tuesday, Nov 4, 2025** on **Sepolia** Superchain, and **Tuesday, Nov 18, 2025** on **Mainnet** Superchain.

  The upgrade will be executed by OP Labs on the following chains: `OP`, `Base`, `Soneium`, `Ink`, `Unichain`, `Metal`, `Mode`, `Zora`, `Arena-Z`, `Swell` (mainnet only).

Chains that inherit activations from the Superchain Registry and are NOT listed above must perform the on-chain upgrade themselves before the activation time.
</Info>

## What's included in Upgrade 16a

Upgrade 17 introduces the following changes:

* **Cannon Go 1.24 support:** upgrading the on-chain fault proof virtual machine implementation to support Go 1.24.
* **Configurable Minimum Base Fee:** allows chain operators to specify a minimum base fee to shorten the length of priority fee auctions (disabled by default).
* **Data Availability Footprint Block Limit:** adds an in-protocol limit to estimated DA usage of transactions to prevent DA spam and priority fee auctions. (enabled by default; can be disabled via zero scalar on-chain).
* **Operator Fee Fix:** enables more flexible fee configurations for rollup operators and lays groundwork for future custom gas token support. If you are running operator fee with nonzero scalars, make sure to adjust them before activating the fork to avoid overcharging users.

For more information on the Jovian implementation details, please review the [Jovian specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/overview.html).

## Breaking Changes - Block header changes

* `extraData` field is extended (for the [minBaseFee](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/exec-engine.html#minimum-base-fee-in-block-header))
* `blobGasUsed` may become nonzero when the DA footprint feature is enabled

The `blobGasUsed` property of each block header is set to that block's `daFootprint`. Note that since Ecotone it was set to `0`, as OP Stack chains don't support blobs. It is now repurposed to store the DA footprint. If you want to disable it, set a scalar of 1. Setting 0 (or never setting the scalar value) implies the default value of the scalar, which can be updated in future forks. Please ensure your nodes and tooling can handle these updated header semantics.

For more information, see the [specs](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/exec-engine.html#da-footprint-block-limit).

## For node operators

Update your node software as soon as possible after release:
* Update `op-node` to [NEED VERSION]
* Update `op-geth` to [NEED VERSION]

## For chain operators

### For permissionless fault proof enabled chains

Chains running permissionless fault proofs will need to deploy new dispute game contracts with new absolute prestates.

<Steps>
  ### Verify the new absolute prestate

  <Info>
    As of upgrade 14, the 64 bit multi-threaded version of cannon is utilized.
  </Info>

  The absolute prestate is generated with the [op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1). You can use this new absolute prestate `0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8` for the following chains:

  *   Mainnet and Sepolia: `OP`, `Base`, `Soneium`, `Ink`and `Unichain`

  You can verify this absolute prestate by running the following [command](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d6fb90dd489e39efa206b55200766ccc075c1d9b/Makefile#L130-L132) in the root of the monorepo on the `op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1` tag:

  ```shell
  make reproducible-prestate
  ```

  This will output the calculated prestates, which will look something like:

  ```shell
  -------------------- Production Prestates --------------------


  Cannon64 Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

  -------------------- Experimental Prestates --------------------

  CannonInterop Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03fc3b4d091527d53f1ff369ea8ed65e5e17cc7fc98ebf75380238151cdc949c

  Cannon64Next Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8
  ```

  *   The "Cannon64" hash is the 64-bit prestate.

  Verify that your target prestate was calculated as expected and matches the corresponding entry in
  [standard-prestates.toml](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/validation/standard/standard-prestates.toml).

  ### Upload your new preimage file

  During the previous step, you also generated the preimage of the absolute prestate, which is the op-program serialized into a binary file. You'll find that new file at `optimism/op-program/bin/prestate-mt64.bin.gz`. Rename that file to have the absolute prestate hash as the filename so it looks like `PRESTATEHASH.bin.gz`.

  Upload that file to where you're storing your other absolute preimage files. This should be the location where you're pointing your `--cannon-prestates-url` at. The `op-challenger` will grab this file and use it when it needs to challenge games.

  ### Execute the upgrade

  Once your `op-challenger` is ready with the new preimage, you can execute the upgrade transaction. This should be done by making a delegatecall to the `upgrade()` function of the OP Contract Manager (at the address listed in [the registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/6621a0f13ce523fe1bb8deea739fe37abe20f90d/validation/standard/standard-versions-mainnet.toml#L22).

  Please simulate and validate the expected output prior to executing the transaction.
