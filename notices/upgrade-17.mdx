title: Upgrade 17 - Jovian Hard Fork
description: Learn how to prepare for the Jovian hard fork
---

The Jovian hardfork is a proposed network upgrade for OP Stack chains, which brings several improvements to the way rollup fees are calculated as well as performing a maintenance update to the fault proof virtual machine.

<Info>
  The Upgrade 17 protocol upgrade on the **Sepolia** Superchain will be executed on **Mon, Nov 3, 2025**, and the **Mainnet** Superchain will be activated on **Wed, Nov 12, 2025**.
  The upgrade will be executed on the following chains: `OP`, `Base`, `Soneium`, `Ink`, and `Unichain`.
  Execution times may vary depending on the current state of each chain.
</Info>

## What's included in Upgrade 16a

Upgrade 17 introduces the following changes:

* **Cannon is being updated to support Go 1.24**, which allows the OP Stack to stay up to date with upstream changes to go-ethereum (which are included in op-geth)
* **Minimum Base Fee and Data Availability Footprint Block Limit** which allows the L2 base fee to respond more rapidly to changes in block composition, particularly when this implies an increased demand on the rollup’s capacity to batch blocks to the data availability layer.
* **Operator Fee Fix** which modifies the existing, optional “operator fee” feature.

For more information on the Jovian implementation details, please review the [Jovian specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/overview.html).

## For node operators

Update your node software as soon as possible after release:
* Update `op-node` to [NEED VERSION]
* Update `op-geth` to [NEED VERSION]

## For chain operators

### For permissionless fault proof enabled chains

Chains running permissionless fault proofs will need to deploy new dispute game contracts with new absolute prestates.

<Steps>
  ### Verify the new absolute prestate

  <Info>
    As of upgrade 14, the 64 bit multi-threaded version of cannon is utilized.
  </Info>

  The absolute prestate is generated with the [op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1). You can use this new absolute prestate `0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8` for the following chains:

  *   Mainnet and Sepolia: `OP`, `Base`, `Soneium`, `Ink`and `Unichain`

  You can verify this absolute prestate by running the following [command](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d6fb90dd489e39efa206b55200766ccc075c1d9b/Makefile#L130-L132) in the root of the monorepo on the `op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1` tag:

  ```shell
  make reproducible-prestate
  ```

  This will output the calculated prestates, which will look something like:

  ```shell
  -------------------- Production Prestates --------------------


  Cannon64 Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

  -------------------- Experimental Prestates --------------------

  CannonInterop Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03fc3b4d091527d53f1ff369ea8ed65e5e17cc7fc98ebf75380238151cdc949c

  Cannon64Next Absolute prestate hash: 
  0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8
  ```

  *   The "Cannon64" hash is the 64-bit prestate.

  Verify that your target prestate was calculated as expected and matches the corresponding entry in
  [standard-prestates.toml](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/validation/standard/standard-prestates.toml).

  ### Upload your new preimage file

  During the previous step, you also generated the preimage of the absolute prestate, which is the op-program serialized into a binary file. You'll find that new file at `optimism/op-program/bin/prestate-mt64.bin.gz`. Rename that file to have the absolute prestate hash as the filename so it looks like `PRESTATEHASH.bin.gz`.

  Upload that file to where you're storing your other absolute preimage files. This should be the location where you're pointing your `--cannon-prestates-url` at. The `op-challenger` will grab this file and use it when it needs to challenge games.

  ### Execute the upgrade

  Once your `op-challenger` is ready with the new preimage, you can execute the upgrade transaction. This should be done by making a delegatecall to the `upgrade()` function of the OP Contract Manager (at the address listed in [the registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/6621a0f13ce523fe1bb8deea739fe37abe20f90d/validation/standard/standard-versions-mainnet.toml#L22).

  Please simulate and validate the expected output prior to executing the transaction.
</Steps>

## For users, developers and ecosystem tools

You may want to migrate to the new `BlobGasUsed` header field now populated by the [DA Footprint Block Limit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/jovian/exec-engine.md#da-footprint-block-limit).
