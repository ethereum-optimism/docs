# Overview

After deploying the L1 smart contracts for your OP Stack chain, it's crucial to verify that your deployment conforms to the standard configuration.
This guide walks you through using `op-validator` to validate your deployment against the Superchain standard.

## Prerequisites

*   Complete deployment of L1 smart contracts using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/smart-contracts).
*   Generate [genesis and rollup](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/genesis) files.
*   Install [op-validator](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-validator).
## Validation process

<Steps>
  ### Install op-validator

  If you haven't already installed op-validator, follow the [installation instructions](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-validator#installation).

  ### Gather required information

  You'll need the following information to validate your deployment:

  *   **L1 RPC URL:** A reliable RPC endpoint for your L1 network
  *   **Absolute prestate:** The absolute prestate hash of your deployment
  *   **Proxy admin address:** Your chain's proxy admin contract address (not the proxy admin owner)
  *   **System config address:** Your chain's SystemConfig contract address
  *   **L2 chain ID:** The chain ID of your L2 network

  Use `op-deployer` to retrieve the following information:

  ```bash
    # Get deployment information
    op-deployer inspect l1 --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id>
  ```

  ### Run validation for your contract version

  Run the op-validator with the appropriate version parameter matching your deployed contracts:

  **For op-contracts v1.8.0:**

  ```bash
      ./bin/op-validator validate v1.8.0 \
      --l1-rpc-url "<YOUR_L1_RPC_URL>" \
      --absolute-prestate "<YOUR_ABSOLUTE_PRESTATE>" \
      --proxy-admin "<YOUR_PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS>" \
      --system-config "<YOUR_SYSTEM_CONFIG_ADDRESS>" \
      --l2-chain-id "<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>" \
      --fail
  ```

  **For op-contracts v2.0.0:**

  ```bash
    ./bin/op-validator validate v2.0.0 \
    --l1-rpc-url "<YOUR_L1_RPC_URL>" \
    --absolute-prestate "<YOUR_ABSOLUTE_PRESTATE>" \
    --proxy-admin "<YOUR_PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS>" \
    --system-config "<YOUR_SYSTEM_CONFIG_ADDRESS>" \
    --l2-chain-id "<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>" \
    --fail
  ```

  ### Review the validation results

  The validator will check multiple aspects of your deployment against the standard configuration:

  *   Contract implementations and versions
  *   Proxy configurations
  *   System parameters
  *   Cross-component relationships
  *   Security settings

  If validation passes, you'll see a success message. If there are issues, you'll see error codes with descriptions like:

  | ERROR     | DESCRIPTION                                            |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | SYSCON-10 | SystemConfig version mismatch                          |
  | SYSCON-40 | SystemConfig implementation address mismatch           |
  | L1xDM-10  | L1CrossDomainMessenger version mismatch                |
  | L1xDM-20  | L1CrossDomainMessenger implementation address mismatch |
  | L1SB-10   | L1StandardBridge version mismatch                      |
  | L1SB-20   | L1StandardBridge implementation address                |

  ### Address any validation errors

  If your deployment has validation errors:

  1.  Understand the errors - Review the error codes and descriptions.
  2.  Consider redeployment - For critical issues, redeploying with corrected parameters may be necessary.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

*   If you plan to join the Superchain, follow the [Standard Rollup Charter](/superchain/blockspace-charter).
*   Configure [monitoring and maintenance](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring)
*   Read the [op-deployer docs](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer)
