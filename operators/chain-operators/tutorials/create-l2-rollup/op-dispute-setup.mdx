title: Monitor your chain with Dispute Monitor
description: Learn how to set up op-dispute-mon to monitor dispute games and fault proof activity on your L2 rollup.
---

Now that you have a running OP Stack rollup with fault proofs enabled, it's critical to monitor your dispute games to ensure your chain operates securely. This tutorial will guide you through setting up `op-dispute-mon` to track all dispute game activity on your rollup.

<Info>
  This tutorial continues from the previous steps in [Creating Your Own L2 Rollup](/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup). Make sure you have completed the op-challenger setup and have dispute games running before proceeding.
</Info>

## What you'll set up

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

*   **op-dispute-mon** monitoring all dispute games on your chain
*   **Real-time tracking** of game status, agreements, and honest actor participation
*   Understanding of key metrics for dispute game health

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

*   Completed all previous steps in the [Creating Your Own L2 Rollup tutorial](/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup)
*   op-challenger running and participating in dispute games
*   op-proposer running and creating proposals
*   L1 RPC endpoint with sufficient rate limits
*   Rollup RPC endpoint (op-node)
*   Docker installed (for Docker setup) OR Go 1.21+ (for build from source)

## What is op-dispute-mon?

`op-dispute-mon` is a specialized monitoring tool that tracks dispute games in the fault proof system. It provides visibility into:

*   **Game status**: Track games from creation to resolution
*   **Honest actor participation**: Monitor your proposer and challenger activity
*   **Agreement tracking**: See which games agree/disagree with your honest actors
*   **Game completion**: Monitor in-progress vs completed games
*   **Ignored games**: Track games that don't meet monitoring criteria

The monitor exposes Prometheus metrics that can be used to build dashboards and alerts.

### Docker Setup

The Docker setup provides a containerized environment for running op-dispute-mon with minimal configuration.

#### Create dispute-mon directory

```bash
# From your project root
cd rollup
mkdir dispute-mon
cd dispute-mon
```

#### Get required addresses

You need three key addresses for op-dispute-mon:

1. **DisputeGameFactory address** (from your deployment)
2. **Proposer address** (your honest actor who creates proposals)
3. **Challenger address** (your honest actor who defends proposals)

```bash
# Get DisputeGameFactory address from deployment
export GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=$(jq -r '.disputeGameFactoryProxyAddress' ../deployer/.deployer/state.json)
echo "Game Factory Address: $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS"

# Get Proposer address (from your proposer setup)
source ../proposer/.env
export PROPOSER_ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
echo "Proposer Address: $PROPOSER_ADDRESS"

# Get Challenger address (from your challenger setup)
source ../challenger/.env
export CHALLENGER_ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
echo "Challenger Address: $CHALLENGER_ADDRESS"
```

#### Create Docker Compose file

Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  op-dispute-mon:
    image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-dispute-mon:v1.4.2-rc.1
    container_name: dispute-mon
    ports:
      - "7300:7300" # Metrics port
    environment:
      # L1 RPC Configuration
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_L1_ETH_RPC=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
      
      # Rollup RPC Configuration (your op-node)
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_ROLLUP_RPC=http://op-node:8547
      
      # Honest Actors (your proposer and challenger addresses)
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_HONEST_ACTORS=${PROPOSER_ADDRESS},${CHALLENGER_ADDRESS}
      
      # DisputeGameFactory Contract Address
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=${GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS}
      
      # Monitoring Configuration
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_MONITOR_INTERVAL=10s
      
      # Logging Configuration
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_LOG_FORMAT=logfmt
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_LOG_LEVEL=info
      
      # Metrics Configuration
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_METRICS_ADDR=0.0.0.0
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_METRICS_ENABLED=true
      - OP_DISPUTE_MON_METRICS_PORT=7300
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - dispute-mon-network

networks:
  dispute-mon-network:
    driver: bridge
```

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_INFURA_KEY` with your actual Infura API key or use another L1 RPC provider. Make sure your L1 RPC has sufficient rate limits for production use.
</Warning>

#### Start op-dispute-mon

```bash
# Export variables
export PROPOSER_ADDRESS=0xYourProposerAddress
export CHALLENGER_ADDRESS=0xYourChallengerAddress
export GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0xYourGameFactoryAddress

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f op-dispute-mon
```

#### Verify it's running

Check that the metrics endpoint is accessible:

```bash
# Query metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:7300/metrics

# You should see Prometheus metrics including:
# - op_dispute_mon_games_agreement
# - op_dispute_mon_ignored_games
# - and many more...
```

Check logs for any errors:

```bash
# View recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50 op-dispute-mon

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f op-dispute-mon
```

You should see logs indicating the monitor is tracking games:

```
level=info msg="Monitoring dispute games" factory=0x... honest_actors=[0x..., 0x...]
level=info msg="Found games" count=5
level=info msg="Updated game status" game=0x... status=IN_PROGRESS
```

./bin/op-dispute-mon --version
```

#### Create directory structure

```bash
# From your project root
cd rollup
mkdir -p dispute-mon/scripts
cd dispute-mon
```

#### Get required addresses

```bash
# Get DisputeGameFactory address
export GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=$(jq -r '.disputeGameFactoryProxyAddress' ../deployer/.deployer/state.json)
echo "Game Factory Address: $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS"

# Get Proposer address
source ../proposer/.env
export PROPOSER_ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
echo "Proposer Address: $PROPOSER_ADDRESS"

# Get Challenger address
source ../challenger/.env
export CHALLENGER_ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
echo "Challenger Address: $CHALLENGER_ADDRESS"

# Get L1 RPC URL

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Load environment variables
source .env

# Path to op-dispute-mon binary
DISPUTE_MON_BIN=../../optimism/op-dispute-mon/bin/op-dispute-mon

echo "Starting op-dispute-mon..."
echo "Game Factory: $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS"
echo "Proposer: $PROPOSER_ADDRESS"
echo "Challenger: $CHALLENGER_ADDRESS"

$DISPUTE_MON_BIN \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \

```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/start-dispute-mon.sh
```

#### Start op-dispute-mon

```bash
# Start in foreground (for testing)
./scripts/start-dispute-mon.sh

# Or start in background
./scripts/start-dispute-mon.sh > logs/dispute-mon.log 2>&1 &

# Save the process ID
echo $! > dispute-mon.pid
```

#### Verify it's running

```bash
# Check if process is running
ps aux | grep op-dispute-mon

# Query metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:7300/metrics

# Check logs
tail -f logs/dispute-mon.log
```

<Step title="Understand key metrics">

Once op-dispute-mon is running, it exposes several important metrics that help you monitor dispute game health.

### Core metrics

Access the metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep op_dispute_mon
```

#### Game agreement metrics

```
# Total number of games tracked
op_dispute_mon_games_agreement 25

# Games currently in progress
op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{completion="in_progress"} 3

# Completed games
op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{completion="complete"} 22

# Games where monitor agrees with honest actors
op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{agreement="agree"} 24

# Games where monitor disagrees
op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{agreement="disagree"} 1
```

**What to monitor:**
- If `agreement="disagree"` is non-zero, investigate immediately - this indicates a potential issue with your honest actors
- High number of `completion="in_progress"` games is normal during active periods
- All completed games should show `agreement="agree"`

#### Ignored games

```
# Games that don't meet monitoring criteria
op_dispute_mon_ignored_games 5
```

Games may be ignored if:
- They don't involve your honest actors
- They use an unsupported game type
- They're outside the monitoring window

#### Game status by type

```
# Games by status
op_dispute_mon_games_status{status="challenger_wins"} 20
op_dispute_mon_games_status{status="defender_wins"} 3
op_dispute_mon_games_status{status="in_progress"} 2
```

**What to monitor:**
- `defender_wins` should be rare (indicates your proposal was successfully defended)
- `challenger_wins` is normal (other proposers' incorrect proposals were challenged)
- `in_progress` shows active games

#### Honest actor metrics

```
# Games involving your honest actors
op_dispute_mon_honest_actor_games{actor="0xYourProposer",role="proposer"} 15
op_dispute_mon_honest_actor_games{actor="0xYourChallenger",role="challenger"} 10
```

**What to monitor:**
- Your proposer should create games regularly
- Your challenger should participate when needed
- If either metric stops increasing, investigate your honest actors

### Metric query examples

Here are some useful queries you can run:

```bash
# Count total games
curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep "op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{" | grep -v "#" | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}'

# Count in-progress games
curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep 'op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{completion="in_progress"}' | awk '{print $2}'

# Count disagreements (should be 0!)
curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep 'op_dispute_mon_games_agreement{agreement="disagree"}' | awk '{print $2}'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Monitor dispute game health">

Use these practices to ensure your dispute games are healthy:

### Daily monitoring checklist

1. **Check for disagreements:**
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep 'agreement="disagree"'
   ```
   Result should be `0` or metric should not exist.

2. **Verify honest actors are active:**
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep "honest_actor_games"
   ```
   Both proposer and challenger metrics should be present and increasing.

3. **Check game completion rate:**
   ```bash
   # Compare in-progress vs complete
   curl -s http://localhost:7300/metrics | grep "completion="
   ```
   Most games should complete within the challenge period (7 days).

4. **Review logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   # Docker
   docker-compose logs --tail=100 op-dispute-mon | grep -i error
   
   # Source
   tail -100 logs/dispute-mon.log | grep -i error
   ```

### Warning signs

**Immediate attention required:**
- Any `agreement="disagree"` metrics
- Honest actor metrics stop increasing
- High number of ignored games involving your actors
- Errors in logs about RPC connectivity
- Errors about invalid game states

**Investigate soon:**
- Games stuck in `in_progress` for >7 days
- Sudden drop in game creation rate
- Increase in `defender_wins` status

**Normal operation:**
- Regular game creation
- All agreements showing `agree`
- Games completing within challenge period
- Occasional `challenger_wins` (other proposals being challenged)

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Now that you have dispute game monitoring set up, you can:

*   Set up additional monitoring for other components (optional)
*   Create alerting for critical metrics like disagreements
*   Explore the [Dispute Monitor Tool Reference](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring)
*   Learn more about the [Fault Proof System](/stack/fault-proofs/explainer)
*   Set up [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/) for advanced metrics visualization (optional)

Congratulations! You now have a fully operational OP Stack L2 rollup with comprehensive monitoring.
