title: Building a Superchain node from source
description: Learn how to build your own node without relying on images from Optimism.
---

Docker images are the easiest way to run an OP Mainnet node, but you can always build your own node from source code.
You might want to do this if you want to run a node on a specific architecture or if you want to inspect the source code of the node you're running.
This guide will walk you through the full process of building a node from source.

## What you're going to build

### Rollup node

The Rollup Node is responsible for deriving L2 block payloads from L1 data and passing those payloads to the Execution Client.
The Rollup Node can also optionally participate in a peer-to-peer network to receive blocks directly from the Sequencer before those blocks are submitted to L1.
The Rollup Node is largely analogous to a [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#what-are-nodes-and-clients) in Ethereum.

In this tutorial you will build the `op-node` implementation of the Rollup Node as found in the [Optimism Monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

### Execution client

The Execution Client is responsible for executing the block payloads it receives from the Rollup Node over JSON-RPC via the standard [Ethereum Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/common.md#engine-api----common-definitions).
The Execution Client exposes the standard JSON-RPC API that Ethereum developers are familiar with, and can be used to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network.
The Execution Client is largely analogous to an [execution client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#what-are-nodes-and-clients) in Ethereum.

  <Tabs.Tab>
    The `op-geth` implementation of the Execution Client can be found in the [`op-geth` repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth).

    #### Prerequisites

    *   Go 1.21 or later
    *   Make

    #### Building

    Follow the instructions in the `op-geth` repository to build from source.
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    `Nethermind` is an alternative execution client implementation written in .NET.

    #### Prerequisites

    *   [.NET SDK](https://aka.ms/dotnet/download) 9 or later

    #### Building

    <Steps>
  1.  Clone the repository:
            The `Nethermind`'s source code can be obtained from [`nethermind` repository](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind)
  
        ```bash
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind.git
        ```
  
        2.  Build the source:
  
        ```bash
        dotnet build src/Nethermind/Nethermind.sln -c release
        ```
  
        3.  Run `Nethermind` (this will build it first if needed):
  
        ```bash
        cd src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Runner
        dotnet run -c release -- -c mainnet
        ```
  
        The build artifacts will be located in `src/Nethermind/artifacts/bin/Nethermind.Runner/release`.
</Steps>

    For more details about running a `Nethermind` node, see the [`Nethermind` documentation](https://docs.nethermind.io/get-started/running-node/).

### Legacy Geth (optional)

Legacy Geth is an optional component for OP Mainnet archive nodes.
Legacy Geth allows you to execute stateful queries like `eth_call` against blocks and transactions that occurred before the OP Mainnet [Bedrock Upgrade](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608050602/https://blog.oplabs.co/introducing-optimism-bedrock/).
Legacy Geth is only relevant to OP Mainnet archive nodes and is not required for full nodes or OP Sepolia nodes.

Currently, `l2Geth` is the only available implementation of Legacy Geth.
In this tutorial you will build the `l2geth` implementation of Legacy Geth as found in the [`optimism-legacy` repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-legacy).

## Software dependencies

Our build environment is managed through a tool called [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). Mise provides a convenient way to install and manage all necessary dependencies for building and testing the packages in this repository. You can find the mise configuration in the [`mise.toml`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/mise.toml) in the root of the Optimism Monorepo.

## Build the rollup node

First you're going to build the `op-node` implementation of the Rollup Node as found in the [Optimism Monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Optimism Monorepo">
The Optimism Monorepo contains the source code for the `op-node`.
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
    cd optimism
    ```

  </Step>
  
    <Step title="Check out the required release branch">
Release branches are created when new versions of the `op-node` are created.
    Read through the [Releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) to determine the correct branch to check out.
  
    ```bash
    git checkout <name of release branch>
    ```
  
    <Info>
      Make sure to read the Releases page carefully to determine the correct branch to check out.
      Some releases may only be required for the OP Sepolia testnet.
    </Info>

  
    </Step>
  
    <Step title="Build `op-node`">
Build the `op-node` implementation of the Rollup Node.
  
    ```bash
    cd op-node
    just
    ```

  
    </Step></Steps>
