# Bridging guides

Looking to build an application that sends ETH, tokens, or data between OP Mainnet and Ethereum?
You'll find some useful guides and tutorials in this area of the docs.
For instance, if you want to learn how to bridge a token from Ethereum to OP Mainnet (or vice versa!), you should check out the [Standard Token Bridge](bridging/standard-bridge).

If you're looking for something more advanced, take a look at the guide on [sending data between L1 and L2](bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, which is pretty cool!
The Standard Token Bridge for OP Mainnet even uses this same message-passing infrastructure under the hood.
