title: Custom bridges
description: Important considerations when building custom bridges for OP Mainnet.

<Info>
  Custom bridges can bring a significant amount of complexity and risk to any project.
  Before you commit to a custom bridge, be sure that the [Standard Bridge](./standard-bridge) definitely does not support your use case.
  [Building a custom bridged token](/app-developers/tutorials/bridging/standard-bridge-custom-token) is often sufficient for projects that need more flexibility.
