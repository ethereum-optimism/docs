title: Sending data between L1 and L2
description: Learn how bridging works between L1 and L2, how to use it, and what to watch out for.
---

<Info>
  This is a high-level overview of the bridging process.
  For a step-by-step tutorial on how to send data between L1 and L2, check out the [Solidity tutorial](/app-developers/tutorials/bridging/cross-dom-solidity).
</Info>

## Understanding contract calls



```solidity
    function doTheThing(address myContractAddress, uint256 myFunctionParam) public {
        MyOtherContract(myContractAddress).doSomething(myFunctionParam);
    }
}
```



```solidity
    function doTheThing(address myContractAddress, uint256 myFunctionParam) public {
        myContractAddress.call(
            abi.encodeCall(
                MyOtherContract.doSomething,
                (
                    myFunctionParam
                )
            )
        );
    }
}
```


## Basics of communication between layers



```solidity
    address _target,
    bytes memory _message,
    uint32 _minGasLimit
) public;
```


1.  The `address _target` of the contract to call on the other layer.
2.  The `bytes memory _message` calldata to send to the contract on the other layer.
3.  The `uint32 _minGasLimit` minimum gas limit that can be used when executing the message on the other layer.


```solidity
address(_target).call{gas: _minGasLimit}(_message);
```



```solidity
// Pretend this is on L2
    function doSomething(uint256 myFunctionParam) public {
        // ... some sort of code goes here
    }
}

// And pretend this is on L1
    function doTheThing(address myOptimisticContractAddress, uint256 myFunctionParam) public {
        messenger.sendMessage(
            myOptimisticContractAddress,
            abi.encodeCall(
                MyOptimisticContract.doSomething,
                (
                    myFunctionParam
                )
            ),
            1000000 // or use whatever gas limit you want
        )
    }
}
```

<Info>
  You can find the addresses of the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` contracts on OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia on the [Contract Addresses](/superchain/addresses) page.

## Communication speed


### For L1 to L2 transactions


### For L2 to L1 transactions



1.  The L2 transaction that sends a message to L1 is sent to the Sequencer.
    This is just like any other L2 transaction and takes just a few seconds to be confirmed by the Sequencer.

2.  The block containing the L2 transaction is proposed to the L1.
    This typically takes approximately 20 minutes.

3.  A proof of the transaction is submitted to the [`OptimismPortal`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/111f3f3a3a2881899662e53e0f1b2f845b188a38/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L209) contract on L1.
    This can be done any time after step 2 is complete.

4.  The transaction is finalized on L1.
    This can *only* be done after the [fault challenge period](#understanding-the-challenge-period) has elapsed.
    This period is 7 days on Ethereum and a few seconds on Sepolia.
    This waiting period is a core part of the security model of the OP Stack and cannot be circumvented.

## Accessing `msg.sender`



```solidity
```


```solidity
    require(
        msg.sender == address(messenger)
        && messenger.xDomainMessageSender() == owner
    );
    _;
}
```

## Fees for sending data between L1 and L2

### For L1 to L2 transactions



<Info>
  Since the gas amount charged is dynamic, the gas burn can change from block to block.
  You should always add a buffer of at least 20% to the gas limit for your L1 to L2 transaction to avoid running out of gas.
</Info>

### For L2 to L1 transactions


1.  An L2 transaction that *initiates* the transaction, which is priced the same as any other transaction made on OP Mainnet.

2.  An L1 transaction that *proves* the transaction.
    This transaction can only be submitted after L2 block, including your L2 transaction, is proposed on L1.
    This transaction is expensive because it includes verifying a [Merkle trie](/connect/resources/glossary#merkle-patricia-trie) inclusion proof on L1.

3.  An L1 transaction that *finalizes* the transaction.
    This transaction can only be submitted after the transaction challenge period (7 days on mainnet) has passed.
