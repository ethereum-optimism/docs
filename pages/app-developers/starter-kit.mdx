# Deploying a SuperchainERC20 (Starter Kit)

The [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter) is a development toolkit designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and testing of SuperchainERC20 tokens. It leverages cross-chain interoperability for the deployment of ERC20 tokens that can be used across different blockchains in the Superchain ecosystem.

## How it works

Here's a breakdown of what's under the hood:

*   **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: SuperchainERC20 tokens can move across multiple chains. This is possible by using the IERC7802 interface, which lets tokens be minted on one chain and burned on another to maintain a consistent supply.

*   **Superchain Network**: The Superchain is a network of connected blockchains, allowing smooth data and asset flow. By using Optimism's scaling solutions, the Superchain reduces gas fees and speeds up transactions.

*   **Deployment**: The kit helps deploy SuperchainERC20 tokens on Ethereum-compatible chains, including setting up contracts, minting, burning, and cross-chain communication.

*   **Testing**: Test scripts simulate real token transfers across chains to ensure everything works properly before going live.

## Setup

<Steps>
  ### Install `foundry`

  `supersim` requires `anvil` to be installed.

  Follow the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) guide for detailed instructions.

  ### Clone the repo

  Next, you need to clone and navigate to the repo:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter.git
  cd superchainerc20-starter
  ```

  ### Install dependencies

  Install project dependencies using `pnpm`:

  ```sh
  pnpm i
  ```

  ### Initialize .env files

  ```sh
  pnpm init:env
  ```

  ### Start the development environment

  This command will:

  *   Start the `supersim` local development environment
  *   Deploy the smart contracts to the test networks
  *   Launch the example frontend application

  ```sh
  pnpm dev
  ```

## Deploy SuperchainERC20s

<Steps>
  ### Configure RPC urls

  This repository includes a script to automatically fetch the public RPC URLs for each chain listed in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json) and add them to the `[rpc_endpoints]` configuration section of `foundry.toml`.

  The script ensures that only new RPC URLs are appended, preserving any URLs already present in `foundry.toml`. To execute this script, run:

  ```sh
  pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
  ```

  ### Modify deploy config parameters

  The deployment configuration for token deployments is managed through the `deploy-config.toml` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of each configuration section:

  #### `[deploy-config]`

  This section defines parameters for deploying token contracts.

  | Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                               | Example                                |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | `salt`    | A unique identifier used for deploying token contracts via \[`Create2`]. This value along with the contract bytecode ensures that contract deployments are deterministic. | `salt = "ethers phoenix"`              |
  | `chains`  | Lists the chains where the token will be deployed. Each chain must correspond to an entry in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of `foundry.toml`.                             | `chains = ["op_chain_a","op_chain_b"]` |

  #### `[token]`

  Deployment configuration for the token that will be deployed.

  | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                        |
  | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `owner_address` | The address designated as the owner of the token. The `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract included in this repo extends the [`Ownable`](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/c3b2ffb4a3334ea519555c5ea11fb0e666f8c2bc/src/auth/Ownable.sol) contract. | `owner_address = "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"` |
  | `name`          | The token's name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `name = "TestSuperchainERC20"`                                 |
  | `symbol`        | The token's symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `symbol = "TSU"`                                               |
  | `decimals`      | The number of decimal places the token supports.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `decimals = 18`                                                |

  ### Deploy a token

  *   Before proceeding, ensure that your `deploy-config.toml` file is fully configured (see the [Modify Deploy Config Parameters](#modify-deploy-config-parameters) section setup details).
  *   Also, confirm that the `[rpc_endpoints]` section in `foundry.toml` is properly set up by following the instructions in [Configure RPC urls](#configure-rpc-urls).

  <Callout>
    Deployments are executed through the `SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol` script. This script deploys tokens across each specified chain in the deployment configuration using `Create2`, ensuring deterministic contract addresses for each deployment. The script targets the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract by default. If you need to modify the token being deployed, either update this file directly or point the script to a custom token contract of your choice.
  </Callout>

  *   To execute a token deployment run:

  ```sh
  pnpm contracts:deploy:token

  ```
</Steps>

## Best practices for deploying SuperchainERC20

### Use `Create2` to deploy SuperchainERC20

`Create2` ensures that the address is deterministically determined by the bytecode of the contract and the provided salt. This is crucial because in order for cross-chain transfers of `SuperchainERC20`s to work with interop, the tokens must be deployed at the same address across all chains.

### Set safe `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` permissions

For best security practices `SuperchainERC20Bridge` should be the only contract with permission to call `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`. These permissions are set up by default when using the `SuperchainERC20` contract.

## Next Steps

*   Test your token deployment on multiple chains using [Supersim](/app-developers/tools/supersim) and run simple [end-to-end integration tests](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter/blob/main/README.md#-e2e-tests).
