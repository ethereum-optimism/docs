# Block explorers

This reference guide lists different block explorers you can use to interact with contract source code and view transaction history for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia.

<Callout type="default">
  This page includes providers that meet specific [inclusion criteria](#inclusion-criteria), as outlined below. Please visit the [community block explorers page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/blob/main/community/tools/block-explorers.md) for an additional listing of third-party block explorers.

## Blockscout

We have a Blockscout explorer for [OP Mainnet](https://optimism.blockscout.com) and [OP Sepolia](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/). It includes:

*   [Verified testnet contract source code, along with the ability to interact with it](https://optimism.blockscout.com/verified-contracts)
*   [Detailed testnet transaction information](https://optimism.blockscout.com/tx/0xa1b04233084d4067ec0bb3e09301012900f0e209f14a3d406f3d6dc696eea138)

Blockscout also has some OP-Mainnet-specific features:

*   [An interactive list of deposits (L1-L2)](https://optimism.blockscout.com/l2-deposits)
*   [An interactive list of withdrawals (L2-L1)](https://optimism.blockscout.com/l2-withdrawals)
*   [Transaction batches](https://optimism.blockscout.com/l2-txn-batches)
*   [App marketplace](https://optimism.blockscout.com/apps)
*   And much more!

## Etherscan

We have Etherscan explorers for the [OP Mainnet](https://explorer.optimism.io) and the [OP Sepolia](https://sepolia-optimistic.etherscan.io/).
Etherscan has lots of tools to help you debug transactions.

Optimistic Etherscan has all the tools you expect from Etherscan, such as:

*   [Verified contract source code, along with the ability to interact with it](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#code)
*   [Detailed transaction information](https://explorer.optimism.io/tx/0x292423266d6da24126dc4e0e81890c22a67295cc8b1a987e71ad84748511452f)
*   And everything else you might find on Etherscan!

It's also got some OP-Mainnet-specific features:

*   [A list of L1-to-L2 transactions](https://explorer.optimism.io/txsEnqueued)
*   [A list of L2-to-L1 transactions](https://explorer.optimism.io/txsExit)
*   [A tool for finalizing L2-to-L1 transactions](https://explorer.optimism.io/messagerelayer)
*   And more! Just check it out and click around to find all of the available features.

## Superscan by Routescan

[Superscan](https://superscan.network) is the dev-focused Superchain explorer unified at the ecosystem level, powered by [Routescan](https://routescan.io).

The Superscan currently includes:

*   Mainnet - OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Cyber, Orderly, Fraxtal, Public Goods Network
*   Testnet - Zora, Mode, Orderly, Fraxtal

## Once Upon

If you're building on multiple chains, Once Upon's [Superchain block explorer](https://www.onceupon.gg/) consolidates transaction data across all OP Chains, offering developers a unified view of all Superchain activity, including testnets.

Once Upon currently supports:

*   Mainnet - Ethereum, OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Public Goods Network
*   Sepolia - Ethereum, OP Sepolia, Base, Zora, Public Goods Network, Lyra, Mode


## Tenderly

Tenderly's [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) for OP Mainnet and Op Sepolia allows you to monitor and inspect transactions, providing high level of details and additional tools:

Tenderly Developer Explorer lets you:

*   Keep track of specific [contracts](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer/contracts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) and their transactions
*   Inspect [transaction execution](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer/inspect-transaction?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) with fully decoded transaction trace
*   [Debug](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) failing and [simulate](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulator-ui/using-simulation-ui?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) correct transactions before sending them on-chain
*   Evaluate [function-level gas usage](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/gas-profiler?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) for any transaction
*   Set up [Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/tutorials-and-quickstarts/alerting-quickstart-guide?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) to monitor interactions, access control, asset transfers, and contracts' state changes
*   Create a [Virtual TestNet](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=optimism) from a specific OP Mainnet or OP Chain transaction for systematic research


## Access to pre-regenesis history

Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).
However, you **can** access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using a number of different tools. For detailed instructions, see [Regenesis History](/operators/node-operators/management/regenesis-history).

## Inclusion criteria

Developer teams who want to feature products/tools on this page must meet the following criteria:

1.  **ongoing partnership** with Optimism whether formal agreement, RPGF, RFP, collaborated on specific initiatives, etc.;
2.  **established user base** and OP ecosystem engagement such as governance participation, homegrown TG or Discord participation, etc.; and
3.  **actively maintained developer tool** that aligns with OP's commitment to a magical developer experience (e.g., easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate, great DevX, highly-rated by community, etc.)

For teams that are supporting but still establishing a user base, we encourage you to share your tool on the [community block explorers page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/blob/main/community/tools/block-explorers.md).
You can also promote your tool in the [developer forum](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) and signup to share your tool at the next [demo day](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/demo-day/).
