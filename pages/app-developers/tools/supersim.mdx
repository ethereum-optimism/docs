# Supersim Multichain Development Environment

[Supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Supersim) is a local development environment tool designed to simulate the Optimism Superchain for developers building multi-chain applications. It provides a simplified way to test and develop applications that interact with multiple chains within the Superchain ecosystem.

## Supersim workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Smart Contracts] --> B[Deploy on Supersim]
    B --> C[Test Cross-Chain Interactions]
    C --> D[Debug and Refine]
    D --> B
    C --> E[Ready for Production]
```

This diagram illustrates the typical workflow for developers using supersim, from writing smart contracts to testing and refining cross-chain interactions.

## Features and benefits

*   Simulates multiple OP Stack chains locally (e.g., chain 901, 902)
*   Supports testing of cross-chain messaging and interactions
*   Includes pre-deployed interoperability contracts
*   Offers a CLI interface for starting and managing Supersim instances
*   Provides local JSON-RPC endpoints for each simulated chain
*   Allows for custom configuration of chain parameters
*   Facilitates testing of Superchain-specific features like SuperchainERC20 tokens
*   Easy to use with common Ethereum development tools 
*   Supports chain forking

## Supersim CLI interaction

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer] --> B[Supersim CLI]
    B --> C[Chain 901]
    B --> D[Chain 902]
    B --> E[...]
    C --> F[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
    D --> G[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
    E --> H[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
```

This diagram illustrates how developers interact with Supersim through the CLI, which simulates OP Stack specific features (specifically interop) on locally run chains, each with its own JSON-RPC endpoint and pre-deployed interoperability contracts.

## Next steps

*   Build a [revolutionary app](/app-developers/get-started) that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
*   Deploy a [SuperchainERC20](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20) to the Superchain
*   View more [Supersim tutorials](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim)
