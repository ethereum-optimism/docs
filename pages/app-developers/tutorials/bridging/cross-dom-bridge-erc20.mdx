# Bridging ERC-20 tokens to OP Mainnet

This tutorial explains how you can use [@eth-optimism/viem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/viem) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from L1 (Ethereum or Sepolia) to L2 (OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia).
The `@eth-optimism/viem` package is an easy way to add bridging functionality to your javascript-based application.
It also provides some safety rails to prevent common mistakes that could cause tokens to be made inaccessible.

Behind the scenes, `@eth-optimism/viem` package uses the [Standard Bridge](/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) contracts to transfer tokens.
Make sure to check out the [Standard Bridge guide](/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) if you want to learn more about how the bridge works under the hood.

<Callout type="error">
  The Standard Bridge **does not** support [**fee on transfer
  tokens**](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer) or [**rebasing
  tokens**](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasingairdrops)
  because they can cause bridge accounting errors.
</Callout>

## Supported networks

The `@eth-optimism/viem` package supports any of the [Superchain networks](/superchain/networks).
If you want to use a network that isn't included by default, you can simply [instantiate the package with the appropriate contract addresses](/app-developers/get-started).

## Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Create a demo project

You're going to use the `@eth-optimism/viem` package for this tutorial.
Since the `@eth-optimism/viem` package is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library, you'll need to create a Node.js project to use it.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Make a Project Folder</h3>}

  ```bash
  mkdir bridging-erc20-tokens
  cd bridging-erc20-tokens
  ```

  {<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm init
  ```

  {<h3>Install the `@eth-optimism/viem`</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm add @eth-optimism/viem
  ```

  {<h3>Install viem</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm add viem
  ```
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Want to create a new wallet for this tutorial? If you have
  [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
  you can run `cast wallet new` in your terminal to create a new wallet and get
  the private key.
</Callout>

## Get ETH on Sepolia and OP Sepolia

This tutorial explains how to bridge tokens from Sepolia to OP Sepolia.
You will need to get some ETH on both of these testnets.

<Callout type="info">
  You can use [this faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com) to get ETH on Sepolia.
  You can use the [Superchain
  Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) to get ETH on OP
  Sepolia.
</Callout>

## Add a private key to your environment

You need a private key to sign transactions.
Set your private key as an environment variable with the `export` command.
Make sure this private key corresponds to an address that has ETH on both Sepolia and OP Sepolia.

```bash
export TUTORIAL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Start the Node REPL

You're going to use the Node REPL to interact with the `@eth-optimism/viem`.
To start the Node REPL, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node
```

This will bring up a Node REPL prompt that allows you to run javascript code.

## Import dependencies

You need to import some dependencies into your Node REPL session.
The `@eth-optimism/viem` package uses ESM modules, and to use in the Node.js REPL, you need to use dynamic imports with await.
Here's how to do it:

<Steps>
  {<h3>Import the @eth-optimism/viem package</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L2-L10 hash=5e88e02086fb2f4cf2e1e99a4cd30b04
  ```
</Steps>

## Set session variables

You'll need a few variables throughout this tutorial.
Let's set those up now.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Load your private key</h3>}

  This step retrieves your private key from the environment variable you set earlier and converts it into an account object that Viem can use for transaction signing.
  The private key is essential for authorizing transactions on both L1 and L2 networks.
  For security reasons, we access it from an environment variable rather than hardcoding it.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L16-L17 hash=6a160f7ff083969091e72c90e1138563
  ```

  {<h3>Create the RPC providers and wallets</h3>}

  Here we establish the connections to both networks by creating four different clients:

  1.  L1 Public Client: For reading data from the Sepolia network
  2.  L1 Wallet Client: For signing and sending transactions on Sepolia
  3.  L2 Public Client: For reading data from OP Sepolia
  4.  L2 Wallet Client: For signing and sending transactions on OP Sepolia

  Each client is configured with the appropriate chain information and RPC endpoint.
  This dual-network setup allows us to seamlessly interact with both layers using the same account.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L22-L42 hash=09b58c5a76517b07e5556069cc10e900
  ```

  {<h3>Set the L1 and L2 ERC-20 addresses</h3>}

  We define the addresses of the ERC-20 tokens on both networks.
  These are specially deployed test tokens with corresponding implementations on both L1 (Sepolia) and L2 (OP Sepolia).
  The L2 token is configured to recognize deposits from its L1 counterpart.
  We also define a constant `oneToken` representing the full unit (10^18 wei) to simplify our deposit and withdrawal operations.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L12-L13 hash=d4da7ec838773c9f0e4ca38f4ba70242
  ```

  <Callout>
    If you're coming from the [Bridging Your Standard ERC-20 Token to OP Mainnet
    Using the Standard Bridge](./standard-bridge-standard-token) or [Bridging Your
    Custom ERC-20 Token to OP Mainnet Using the Standard
    Bridge](./standard-bridge-custom-token) tutorials, you can use the addresses
    of your own ERC-20 tokens here instead.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

## Get L1 tokens

You're going to need some tokens on L1 that you can bridge to L2.
The L1 testing token located at [`0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129) has a `faucet` function that makes it easy to get tokens.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Set the ERC20 ABI</h3>}

  The Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines how to interact with the smart contract functions. This ERC-20 ABI includes several critical functions:

  *   `balanceOf`: Allows us to check token balances for any address
  *   `faucet`: A special function in this test token that mints new tokens to the caller
  *   `approve`: Required to grant the bridge permission to transfer tokens on our behalf
  *   `allowance`: To check how many tokens we've approved for the bridge
  *   `decimals` and `symbol`: Provide token metadata

  This comprehensive ABI gives us everything we need to manage our tokens across both layers.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L44-L95 hash=7967d72de2b91fb16ba2b4723995e307
  ```

  {<h3>Request some tokens</h3>}

  Now we'll call the `faucet` function on the L1 test token contract to receive free tokens for testing.
  This transaction will mint new tokens directly to our wallet address. The function doesn't require any parameters - it simply credits a predetermined amount to whoever calls it.
  We store the transaction hash for later reference and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L97-L104 hash=90511372fb9f975abfa8ec68659eb4a0
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance</h3>}

  After using the faucet, we verify our token balance by calling the `balanceOf` function on the L1 token contract.
  This step confirms that we've successfully received tokens before proceeding with the bridging process.
  The balance is returned in the smallest unit (wei), but we format it into a more readable form using the `formatEther` function since this token uses 18 decimal places.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L109-L115 hash=63fcd2ca7e6fe0466340d615950e9658
  ```
</Steps>

## Deposit tokens

Now that you have some tokens on L1, you can deposit those tokens into the `L1StandardBridge` contract.
You'll then receive the same number of tokens on L2 in return.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Define the amount to deposit</h3>}

  We define a variable `oneToken` that represents 1 full token in its base units (wei). ERC-20 tokens typically use 18 decimal places, so 1 token equals 10^18 wei. This constant helps us work with precise token amounts in our transactions, avoiding rounding errors and ensuring exact value transfers.
  We'll use this value for both deposits and withdrawals

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L14 hash=1940b943a802d51e41572bc7d6bc4515
  ```

  {<h3>Allow the Standard Bridge to access your tokens</h3>}

  ERC-20 tokens require a two-step process for transferring tokens on behalf of a user.
  First, we must grant permission to the bridge contract to spend our tokens by calling the `approve` function on the token contract.
  We specify the bridge address from the chain configuration and the exact amount we want to bridge.
  This approval transaction must be confirmed before the bridge can move our tokens.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L118 hash=ac9e54acf2ec86ebca47858a733d2419
  ```

  {<h3>Wait for approval</h3>}

  After submitting the approval transaction, we need to wait for it to be confirmed on the L1 blockchain.
  We use the `waitForTransactionReceipt` function to monitor the transaction until it's included in a block. The receipt provides confirmation details, including which block includes our transaction.
  This step ensures our approval is finalized before attempting to bridge tokens.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L119-L125 hash=74761239bfa34376baf7439b903bb346
  ```

  {<h3>Deposit your tokens</h3>}

  Now we can execute the actual bridging operation using the `depositERC20` function from the `@eth-optimism/viem` package. This function handles all the complex interactions with the L1StandardBridge contract for us. We provide:

  *   The addresses of both the L1 and L2 tokens
  *   The amount to bridge
  *   The target chain (OP Sepolia)
  *   Our wallet address as the recipient on L2
  *   A minimum gas limit for the L2 transaction

  This streamlined process ensures our tokens are safely transferred to L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L130-L139 hash=5084d848deaf4b798706446a24e54a18
  ```

  <Callout>
    Using a smart contract wallet? As a safety measure, `depositERC20` will fail
    if you try to deposit ETH from a smart contract wallet without specifying a
    `recipient`. Add the `recipient` option to the `depositERC20` call to fix
    this. Check out the [@eth-optimism/viem
    docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/tree/main/packages/viem) for
    more info on the options you can pass to `depositERC20`.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Wait for the deposit to be relayed</h3>}

  After initiating the deposit, we need to wait for the L1 transaction to be confirmed.
  This function tracks the transaction until it's included in an L1 block.
  Note that while this confirms the deposit was accepted on L1, there will still be a short delay (typically a few minutes) before the tokens appear on L2, as the transaction needs to be processed by the Optimism sequencer.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L141-L142 hash=886c0a2fe4aa92dc67288d02bb654c3e
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L1</h3>}

  After the deposit transaction is confirmed, we check our token balance on L1 again to verify that the tokens have been deducted.
  This balance should be lower by the amount we bridged, as those tokens are now escrowed in the `L1StandardBridge` contract.
  This step helps confirm that the first part of the bridging process completed successfully:

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L148-L154 hash=0286a14fc56fcef03c02c57219045c36
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L2</h3>}

  After allowing some time for the L2 transaction to be processed, we check our token balance on L2 to verify that we've received the bridged tokens.
  The newly minted L2 tokens should appear in our wallet at the same address we used on L1.
  This step confirms the complete success of the bridge operation from L1 to L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L177-L183 hash=bf12c15e0ea43846a09176d351bf4f33
  ```
</Steps>

## Withdraw tokens

You just bridged some tokens from L1 to L2.
Nice!
Now you're going to repeat the process in reverse to bridge some tokens from L2 to L1.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Initiate the withdrawal</h3>}

  To move tokens back to L1, we use the `withdrawOptimismERC20` function from the `@eth-optimism/viem` package.
  This function interacts with the `L2StandardBridge` contract to initialize the withdrawal process.
  We specify:

  *   The L2 token address
  *   The amount to withdraw (we're using half of a token in this example)
  *   Our address as the recipient on L1
  *   A minimum gas limit for the transaction

  Unlike deposits, withdrawals from L2 to L1 are not immediate and require a multi-step process including a 7-day challenge period for security reasons.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L156-L163 hash=3e49b4a0e787f1dd2939d52cb3425a1a
  ```

  {<h3>Wait for the transaction receipt</h3>}

  Similar to deposits, we wait for the withdrawal transaction to be confirmed on L2.
  This receipt provides confirmation that the withdrawal has been initiated.
  The transaction logs contain critical information that will be used later in the withdrawal verification process.
  This is only the first step in the withdrawal - the tokens are now locked on L2, but not yet available on L1.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L165-L167 hash=33228f50bcca1c373a6f7e11917b1a3f
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    This step can take a few minutes. Feel free to take a quick break while you
    wait.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L2</h3>}

  After the withdrawal transaction is confirmed, we check our token balance on L2 again to verify that the tokens have been deducted.
  Our L2 balance should now be lower by the amount we initiated for withdrawal.
  At this point, the withdrawal process has begun, but the tokens are not yet available on L1 - they will become accessible after the 7-day challenge period and after completing the "prove" and "finalize" withdrawal steps.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L177-L183 hash=bf12c15e0ea43846a09176d351bf4f33
  ```
</Steps>

## Next steps

Congrats!
You've just deposited and withdrawn tokens using `@eth-optimism/viem` package.
You should now be able to write applications that use the `@eth-optimism/viem` package to transfer ERC-20 tokens between L1 and L2.
Although this tutorial used Sepolia and OP Sepolia, the same process works for Ethereum and OP Mainnet.
