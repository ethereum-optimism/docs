# Communicating between OP Stack and Ethereum in Solidity

This tutorial explains how to write Solidity contracts on OP Stack and Ethereum that can talk to each other.
Here you'll use a contract on OP Stack that can set a "greeting" variable on a contract on Ethereum, and vice-versa.
This is a simple example, but the same technique can be used to send any kind of message between the two chains.

You won't actually be deploying any smart contracts as part of this tutorial.
Instead, you'll reuse existing contracts that have already been deployed to OP Stack and Ethereum.
Later in the tutorial you'll learn exactly how these contracts work so you can follow the same pattern to deploy your own contracts.

## Message passing basics

OP Stack uses a smart contract called the `CrossDomainMessenger` to pass messages between OP Stack and Ethereum.
Both chains have a version of this contract (the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and the `L2CrossDomainMessenger`).
Messages sent from Ethereum to OP Stack are automatically relayed behind the scenes.
Messages sent from OP Stack to Ethereum must be explicitly relayed with a second transaction on Ethereum.
Read more about message passing in the guide to [Sending Data Between L1 and L2](/app-developers/bridging/messaging).

## Get ETH on Sepolia and OP Sepolia

This tutorial explains how to send messages from Sepolia to OP Sepolia.
You will need to get some ETH on both of these testnets.

<Callout type="info">
You can use [this faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to get ETH on Sepolia.
You can use the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=op-docs&utm_medium=docs) to get ETH on OP Sepolia.
</Callout>

## Review the contracts
You're about to use two contracts that have already been deployed to Sepolia and OP Sepolia, the `Greeter` contracts.
You can review the source code for the L1 `Greeter` contract [here on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x31A6Dd971306bb72f2ffF771bF30b1B98dB8B2c5#code).
You can review the source code for the L2 `Greeter` contract [here on Etherscan](https://testnet-explorer.optimism.io/address/0x5DE8a2957eddb140567fF90ba5d57bc9769f3055#code).
Both contracts have exactly the same source code.

Feel free to review the source code for these two contracts now if you'd like.
This tutorial will explain how these contracts work in detail later on in the [How It Works](#how-it-works) section below.

## Interact with the L1 Greeter

You're first going to use the L1 `Greeter` contract to set the greeting on the L2 `Greeter` contract.
You'll send a transaction directly to the L1 `Greeter` contract which will ask the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` to send a message to the L2 `Greeter` contract.
After just a few minutes, you'll see the corresponding greeting set on the L2 `Greeter` contract.

<Steps>

{<h3>Connect to Etherscan</h3>}

Sending a message to the L2 `Greeter` contract via the L1 `Greeter` contract requires that you call the `sendGreeting` function.
For simplicity, you'll interact with the contract directly on Etherscan.
Open up the [L1 `Greeter` contract on Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x31A6Dd971306bb72f2ffF771bF30b1B98dB8B2c5#writeContract) and click the "Connect to Web3" button.

{<h3>Send your greeting</h3>}

Put a greeting into the field next to the "sendGreeting" function and click the "Write" button.
You can use any greeting you'd like.

{<h3>Wait a few minutes</h3>}

It will take a few minutes for your message to reach L2.
Feel free to take a quick break while you wait.

<Callout type="info">
You can use Viem to programmatically check the status of any message between L1 and L2.
Later on in this tutorial you'll learn how to use Viem and the `waitToProve` function to wait for various message statuses.
This same function can be used to wait for a message to be relayed from L1 to L2.
</Callout>

{<h3>Check the L2 Greeter</h3>}

After a few minutes, you should see the greeting on the L2 `Greeter` contract change to the greeting you set.
Open up the [L2 `Greeter` contract on OP Sepolia Etherscan](https://testnet-explorer.optimism.io/address/0x5DE8a2957eddb140567fF90ba5d57bc9769f3055#readContract) and click the "Read Contract" button.
Paste your address into the field next to the "greeting" function and click the "Query" button.
You should see the message you sent from L1.

<Callout>
Haven't seen your message yet?
You might need to wait a little longer.
L2 transactions triggered on L1 are typically processed within one minute but can occasionally be slightly delayed.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Interact with the L2 Greeter

Now you're going to use the L2 `Greeter` contract to set the greeting on the L1 `Greeter` contract.
You'll send a transaction directly to the L2 `Greeter` contract which will ask the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` to send a message to the L1 `Greeter` contract.
Unlike the previous step, you'll need to relay the message from L2 to L1 yourself!
You'll do this by sending two transactions on Sepolia, one proving transaction and one relaying transaction.

<Steps>

{<h3>Connect to Etherscan</h3>}

Just like before, sending a message to the L1 `Greeter` contract via the L2 `Greeter` contract requires that you call the `sendGreeting` function.
Open up the [L2 `Greeter` contract on OP Sepolia Etherscan](https://testnet-explorer.optimism.io/address/0x5DE8a2957eddb140567fF90ba5d57bc9769f3055#writeContract) and click the "Connect to Web3" button.

{<h3>Send your greeting</h3>}

Put a greeting into the field next to the "sendGreeting" function and click the "Write" button.
You can use any greeting you'd like.

<Callout>
Copy the transaction hash from the transaction you just sent.
You'll need this for the next few steps.
Feel free to keep this tab open so you can easily copy the transaction hash later.
</Callout>

{<h3>Create a demo project folder</h3>}

You're going to use the viem to prove and relay your message to L1.

```bash
mkdir cross-dom
cd cross-dom
```

{<h3>Initialize the project</h3>}

Set up the project as a basic Node.js project with `pnpm` or your favorite package manager.

```bash
pnpm init
```

{<h3>Install viem</h3>}

Install Viem with `pnpm` or your favorite package manager.

```bash
pnpm add viem
```

{<h3>Add your private key to your environment</h3>}

You need a private key in order to sign transactions.
Set your private key as an environment variable with the `export` command.
Make sure this is the private key for the address you used to send the transaction to the L2 `Greeter` contract.

```bash
export TUTORIAL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

{<h3>Add your transaction hash to your environment</h3>}

You'll also need the hash of the transaction you sent to the L2 `Greeter` contract.
Set this as an environment variable with the `export` command.

```bash
export TUTORIAL_TRANSACTION_HASH=0x...
```

{<h3>Start a Node REPL</h3>}

Now you'll use the Node.js REPL to run a few commands.
Start the Node.js REPL with the `node` command.

```bash
node
```

{<h3>Import viem</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L3-L6 hash=ab7ce5835f34a359602c8fe03080c3ed
```

{<h3>Create the RPC providers and wallets</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L8-L20 hash=9500ca6be35774522cce2260cd8e9cb6
```

{<h3>Wait until the message is ready to prove</h3>}

Next, you will send messages from L2 to L1 is to prove that the message was sent on L2.
You first need to wait until the message is ready to prove.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L22-L30 hash=0e460f24fc394acdcdb7f06df0188e31
```

<Callout type="info">
This step can take a few minutes.
Feel free to take a quick break while you wait.
</Callout>

{<h3>Prove the message on L1</h3>}

Once the message is ready to be proven, you'll send an L1 transaction to prove that the message was sent on L2.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L32-L36 hash=6b44abbea96103df0513d098ae6e6659
```

{<h3>Build parameters to prove the withdrawal on the L2</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L38-L44 hash=a31f720f43df1680f5488ea233cc9506
```

{<h3>Wait until the message is ready for relay</h3>}

The final step to sending messages from L2 to L1 is to relay the messages on L1.
This can only happen after the fault proof period has elapsed.
On OP Stack, this takes 7 days.

<Callout>
We're currently testing fault proofs on OP Sepolia, so withdrawal times reflect Mainnet times.
</Callout>

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L46-L50 hash=8c08d1f4c6a7f5d1754a411b3590530d
```

{<h3>Relay the message on L1</h3>}

Once the withdrawal is ready to be relayed you can finally complete the message sending process.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L52-L54 hash=d64917e14a9004ef0b81e3f08003d5cd
```

{<h3>Wait until the message is relayed</h3>}

Now you simply wait until the message is relayed.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.js#L56-L62 hash=5a0d3a97f8d71f11c1e46c5e4a734ffb
```

{<h3>Check the L1 Greeter</h3>}

Now that you've relayed the message, you should see the greeting on the L1 `Greeter` contract change to the greeting you set.
Open up the [L1 `Greeter` contract on Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x31A6Dd971306bb72f2ffF771bF30b1B98dB8B2c5#readContract) and click the "Read Contract" button.
Paste your address into the field next to the "greeting" function and click the "Query" button.
You should see the message you sent from L2.

</Steps>

## How it works

Congratulations!
You've successfully sent a message from L1 to L2 and from L2 to L1.
This section will explain how the `Greeter` contracts work so you can follow the same pattern to deploy your own contracts.
Luckily, both `Greeter` contracts are exactly the same so it's easy to see how everything comes together.

### The Messenger variable

The `Greeter` contract has a `MESSENGER` variable that keeps track of the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract on the current chain.
Check out the [Contract Addresses page](/superchain/addresses) to see the addresses of the `CrossDomainMessenger` contracts on whichever network you'll be using.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L14 hash=ce8be857d4b4e1992cd3c16b8f2864b9
```

### The other Greeter variable

The `Greeter` contract also has an `OTHER_GREETER` variable that keeps track of the `Greeter` contract on the other chain.
On L1, this variable is set to the address of the L2 `Greeter` contract, and vice-versa.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L15 hash=eedd8c3050a83e56f37f367c6faa6f5d
```

### The Greetings mapping

The `Greeter` contract keeps track of the different greetings that users have sent inside a `greetings` mapping.
By using a mapping, this contract can keep track of greetings from different users at the same time.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L16 hash=832732d9d5aface44c16c1ae9ecde7b2
```

### The Constructor

The `Greeter` has a simple constructor that sets the `MESSENGER` and `OTHER_GREETER` variables.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L18-L24 hash=718f3dc498975548eec30da99e47adf2
```

### The sendGreeting function

The `sendGreeting` function is the most important function in the `Greeter` contract.
This is what you called earlier to send messages in both directions.
All this function is doing is using the `sendMessage` function found within the `CrossChainMessenger` contract to send a message to the `Greeter` contract on the other chain.

Here, the first parameter is the address of the recipient of the message (the `Greeter` contract on the other chain).
The second parameter is the ABI-encoded function call to the `setMessage` function.
The final parameter is the gas limit that gets used when the message is relayed on the other side.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L26-L38 hash=3104a6775fe3a505cf2f84b71b078aee
```

### The setGreeting function

The `setMessage` function is the function that actually sets the greeting.
This function is called by the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract on the other chain.
It checks explicitly that the function can only be called by the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract.
It also checks that the `CrossChainMessenger` is saying that the message came from the `Greeter` contract on the other chain.
Finally, it sets the greeting in the `greetings` mapping.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-solidity.sol#L40-L52 hash=f50a94e77ecb2f76b9fe278b058a79e4
```

<Callout>
The two `require` statements in this function are important!
Without them, anyone could call this function and set the greeting to whatever they want.
You can follow a similar pattern in your own smart contracts.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

You just learned how you can write Solidity contracts on Sepolia and OP Sepolia that can talk to each other.
You can follow the same pattern to write contracts that can talk to each other on Ethereum and OP Stack.

This sort of cross-chain communication is useful for a variety of reasons.
For example, the [Standard Bridge](/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) contracts use this same system to bridge ETH and ERC-20 tokens between Ethereum and OP Stack.

One cool way to take advantage of cross-chain communication is to do most of your heavy lifting on OP Stack and then send a message to Ethereum only when you have important results to share.
This way you can take advantage of the low gas costs on OP Stack while still being able to use Ethereum when you need it.
