# Installation

This page provides installation instructions for `supersim`.

<Steps>
  ### Prerequisites: `foundry`

  `supersim` requires `anvil`, which is installed alongside the Foundry toolchain.

  Follow the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) guide for detailed instructions.

  ### Install `supersim`
  Either download precompiled binaries or install using Homebrew:

  *   Precompiled binaries: Download the executable for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/releases).

  *   Homebrew: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (OS X, Linux), and then run:

  ```sh
  brew tap ethereum-optimism/tap
  brew install supersim
  ```

  ### Start `supersim` in vanilla mode
  Start `supersim` in vanilla mode by running:

    ```sh
  supersim
  ```
  Vanilla mode will start 3 chains, with the OP Stack contracts already deployed.
  
    *   (1) L1 Chain
        *   Chain 900
    *   (2) L2 Chains
        *   Chain 901
        *   Chain 902


</Steps>

## Next steps

*   Continue to the [First Steps](first-steps) tutorial to try L1 to L2 message passing.
*   Explore [Supersim](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim) features, particularly in [vanilla mode](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim/reference/vanilla), which starts 3 chains (L1 and L2).
