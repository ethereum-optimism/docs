# Installation

This page provides installation instructions for `supersim`.

<Steps>
  ### Prerequisites: `foundry`

  `supersim` requires `anvil` to be installed.

  Follow the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) guide for detailed instructions.

  ### Install `supersim`

  *   Get the precompiled binaries by downloading the executable for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/releases).

  *   Get Homebrew (OS X, Linux).

  ```sh
  brew tap ethereum-optimism/tap
  brew install supersim
  ```

  ### Start `supersim` in vanilla mode

  ```sh
  supersim
  ```

  Vanilla mode will start 3 chains, with the OP Stack contracts already deployed.

  *   (1) L1 Chain
      *   Chain 900
  *   (2) L2 Chains
      *   Chain 901
      *   Chain 902
</Steps>

## Next steps

*   Continue to the [First Steps](first-steps) tutorial to try L1 to L2 message passing.
*   Explore [Supersim](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim) features, particularly in [vanilla mode](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim/reference/vanilla), which starts 3 chains (L1 and L2).
