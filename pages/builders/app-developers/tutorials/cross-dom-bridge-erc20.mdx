# Bridging ERC-20 tokens to OP Mainnet with the Optimism SDK



This tutorial explains how you can use the [Optimism SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from L1 (Ethereum or Sepolia) to L2 (OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia).
The Optimism SDK is an easy way to add bridging functionality to your javascript-based application.
It also provides some safety rails to prevent common mistakes that could cause tokens to be made inaccessible.

Behind the scenes, the Optimism SDK uses the [Standard Bridge](/builders/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) contracts to transfer tokens.
Make sure to check out the [Standard Bridge guide](/builders/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) if you want to learn more about how the bridge works under the hood.

<Callout type="error">
  The Standard Bridge **does not** support [**fee on transfer
  tokens**](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer) or [**rebasing
  tokens**](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasingairdrops)
  because they can cause bridge accounting errors.
</Callout>

## Supported networks

The Optimism SDK supports any of the [Superchain networks](/chain/networks).
[Some Superchain networks](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid) are already included in the SDK by default.
If you want to use a network that isn't included by default, you can simply [instantiate the SDK with the appropriate contract addresses](/builders/app-developers/overview).

## Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Create a demo project

You're going to use the Optimism SDK for this tutorial.
Since the Optimism SDK is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library, you'll need to create a Node.js project to use it.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Make a Project Folder</h3>}

  ```bash
  mkdir op-sample-project
  cd op-sample-project
  ```

  {<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm init
  ```

  {<h3>Install the Optimism SDK</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm add @eth-optimism/sdk
  ```

  {<h3>Install ethers.js</h3>}

  ```bash
  pnpm add ethers@^5
  ```
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Want to create a new wallet for this tutorial? If you have
  [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
  you can run `cast wallet new` in your terminal to create a new wallet and get
  the private key.
</Callout>

## Get ETH on Sepolia and OP Sepolia

This tutorial explains how to bridge tokens from Sepolia to OP Sepolia.
You will need to get some ETH on both of these testnets.

<Callout type="info">
  You can use [this faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com) to get ETH on Sepolia.
  You can use the [Superchain
  Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) to get ETH on OP
  Sepolia.
</Callout>

## Add a private key to your environment

You need a private key to sign transactions.
Set your private key as an environment variable with the `export` command.
Make sure this private key corresponds to an address that has ETH on both Sepolia and OP Sepolia.

```bash
export TUTORIAL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Start the Node REPL

You're going to use the Node REPL to interact with the Optimism SDK.
To start the Node REPL, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node
```

This will bring up a Node REPL prompt that allows you to run javascript code.

## Import dependencies

You need to import some dependencies into your Node REPL session.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Import the Optimism SDK</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L3 hash=26b2fdb17dd6c8326a54ec51f0769528
  ```

  {<h3>Import ethers.js</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L4 hash=69a65ef97862612e4978b8563e6dbe3a
  ```
</Steps>

## Set session variables

You'll need a few variables throughout this tutorial.
Let's set those up now.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Load your private key</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L6 hash=755b77a7ffc7dfdc186f36c37d3d847a
  ```

  {<h3>Create the RPC providers and wallets</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L8-L11 hash=9afdce50665ae93bce602068071ffaa1
  ```

  {<h3>Set the L1 and L2 ERC-20 addresses</h3>}

  This tutorial uses existing ERC-20 tokens that have been deployed on Sepolia and OP Sepolia.
  These tokens are designed for testing the bridging process.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L13-L14 hash=d8f0d4c8124782a6cd36097ff31010e5
  ```

  <Callout>
    If you're coming from the [Bridging Your Standard ERC-20 Token to OP Mainnet
    Using the Standard Bridge](./standard-bridge-standard-token) or [Bridging Your
    Custom ERC-20 Token to OP Mainnet Using the Standard
    Bridge](./standard-bridge-custom-token) tutorials, you can use the addresses
    of your own ERC-20 tokens here instead.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

## Get L1 tokens

You're going to need some tokens on L1 that you can bridge to L2.
The L1 testing token located at [`0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129) has a `faucet` function that makes it easy to get tokens.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Set the ERC20 ABI</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L16 hash=d1caeba8dc014637e2b0b72f5cd076d0
  ```

  {<h3>Create a Contract instance for the L1 token</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L18 hash=9f9d7e38319ff5263e0e99d80d495554
  ```

  {<h3>Request some tokens</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L21-L22 hash=3533ec5426e8845fdb9af1e9e8d3de4c
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L25 hash=d7a60aa394d1055555c2aeab2a2e111d
  ```
</Steps>

## Deposit tokens

Now that you have some tokens on L1, you can deposit those tokens into the `L1StandardBridge` contract.
You'll then receive the same number of tokens on L2 in return.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Define the amount to deposit</h3>}

  The testing token has 18 decimal places, so you'll want to define a variable that represents one token.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L27 hash=9349517ae6165a8798e49750da8faeee
  ```

  {<h3>Create a CrossChainMessenger instance</h3>}

  The Optimism SDK exports a `CrossChainMessenger` class that makes it easy to interact with the `L1StandardBridge` contract.

  Create an instance of the `CrossChainMessenger` class:

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L29-L34 hash=997b9c4cdd5fb1f9d4e0882a683ae016
  ```

  {<h3>Allow the Standard Bridge to access your tokens</h3>}

  Before you can deposit your tokens, you'll need to give the Standard Bridge contract an allowance of tokens on L1.
  This will allow the Standard Bridge to pull these tokens out of your address and escrow inside the bridge.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L37-L38 hash=3d9347e57540e808d71230c1bbe49db5
  ```

  {<h3>Deposit your tokens</h3>}

  Now you can deposit your tokens into the Standard Bridge contract.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L41-L42 hash=0dc6191c87c0a371d7a469ed98190e57
  ```

  <Callout>
    Using a smart contract wallet? As a safety measure, `depositERC20` will fail
    if you try to deposit ETH from a smart contract wallet without specifying a
    `recipient`. Add the `recipient` option to the `depositERC20` call to fix
    this. Check out the [Optimism SDK
    docs](https://sdk.optimism.io/classes/crosschainmessenger#depositERC20-2) for
    more info on the options you can pass to `depositERC20`.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Wait for the deposit to be relayed</h3>}

  You can use the `waitForMessageStatus` function to wait for the deposit to be relayed to L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L45 hash=659971675ab8d53bc2bd5196f72c873b
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L1</h3>}

  You should now have one less token on L1.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L48 hash=d7a60aa394d1055555c2aeab2a2e111d
  ```

  {<h3>Create a Contract instance for the L2 token</h3>}

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L50 hash=d7ab5afad79dafcb7be976c3d0d3df84
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L2</h3>}

  You should now have one more token on L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L53 hash=b332b68817359e4c6e991ed83de6e490
  ```
</Steps>

## Withdraw tokens

You just bridged some tokens from L1 to L2.
Nice!
Now you're going to repeat the process in reverse to bridge some tokens from L2 to L1.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Start your withdrawal on L2</h3>}

  The first step to withdrawing tokens from L2 to L1 is to start the withdrawal on L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L56-L57 hash=b97f906085a2c350d9113488ea9b1d45
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L2</h3>}

  You should now have one less token on L2, but your token balance on L1 will not have changed yet.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L60 hash=b332b68817359e4c6e991ed83de6e490
  ```

  {<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is ready to prove</h3>}

  The second step to withdrawing tokens from L2 to L1 is to prove to the bridge on L1 that the withdrawal happened on L2.
  You first need to wait until the withdrawal is ready to prove.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L63 hash=e8b55ec0f16f90ba4d4197cf47ff8e6d
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    This step can take a few minutes. Feel free to take a quick break while you
    wait.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Prove the withdrawal on L1</h3>}

  Once the withdrawal is ready to be proven, you'll send an L1 transaction to prove that the withdrawal happened on L2.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L66 hash=fee5f5e924472ee9daceb681ccae1cb9
  ```

  {<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is ready for relay</h3>}

  The final step to withdrawing tokens from L2 to L1 is to relay the withdrawal on L1.
  This can only happen after the fault proof period has elapsed.
  On OP Mainnet, this takes 7 days.

  <Callout>
    We're currently testing fault proofs on OP Sepolia, so withdrawal times
    reflect Mainnet times.
  </Callout>

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L69 hash=55a41ac5586b8a688ffd6dfbb20f2d15
  ```

  {<h3>Relay the withdrawal on L1</h3>}

  Once the withdrawal is ready to be relayed, you can finally complete the withdrawal process.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L85 hash=f8d30944dad1664d82b9fdf14da59f9e
  ```

  {<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is relayed</h3>}

  Now you simply wait until the message is relayed.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L88 hash=c2c14a739c44011a058e9848a0019f15
  ```

  {<h3>Check your token balance on L1</h3>}

  You should now have one more token on L1.

  ```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L91 hash=d7a60aa394d1055555c2aeab2a2e111d
  ```
</Steps>

## Next steps

Congrats!
You've just deposited and withdrawn tokens using the Optimism SDK.
You should now be able to write applications that use the Optimism SDK to transfer ERC-20 tokens between L1 and L2.
Although this tutorial used Sepolia and OP Sepolia, the same process works for Ethereum and OP Mainnet.
