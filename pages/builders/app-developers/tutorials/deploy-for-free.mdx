# Deploying Your Contracts for Free on the Superchain

This tutorial walks you through the process of verifying and deploying your contracts on the [Superchain Developer Console](https://console.optimism.io/?utm_source=docs) and claiming your deployment rebate.

## Prerequisites

*   You must have signed up to the [Superchain Developer Console](https://console.optimism.io/?utm_source=docs) before deploying your contract(s)
*   You should have a [Coinbase Verification](https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify) linked with your Superchain Dev Console account

## Launch for free

<Steps>
  ### Get your Coinbase Verification

  Coinbase Verifications leverage the Ethereum Attestation Service to enable the issuance of Coinbase-verified, onchain attestations. If you already have a [Coinbase Verification](https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify), proceed to the next step.

  *   To get your verification, go to the [Coinbase Verification](https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify) page and click **Get verified**.
  *   Login with your Coinbase account and go through the Coinbase Verification flow to get your preferred public key verified.

  ### Link your wallet on the Superchain Dev Console

  *   Once you have your Coinbase Verification, go the [Superchain Developer Console](https://console.optimism.io/?utm_source=docs) and login with your preferred email.
  *   Select the account drop down and click **Wallets**. Click **Link wallet**, and follow the connect wallet flow to link your public key that has a Coinbase Verification to associate your public key with your Superchain Developer Console login.

  ### Verify your contracts on the Superchain Dev Console

  *   Once you have linked your wallet to the [Superchain Developer Console](https://console.optimism.io/?utm_source=docs), click the banner for **Launch anywhere in the Superchain for free**.
  *   In the contracts section, add your contract address, deployment transaction hash, deployer address, and select the chain you deployed on.
  *   Click **Verify**, and proceed with proving ownership of the contract deployment.

  ### Claim your deployment rebates on the Superchain Dev Console

  <Callout type="info">
