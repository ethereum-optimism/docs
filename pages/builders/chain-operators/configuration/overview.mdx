# Chain Operator Configurations

OP Stack chains can be configured for the Chain Operator's needs. Each  
component of the stack has its own considerations. See the following for 
documentation for details on configuring each piece.

<Steps>

  {<h3>Rollup Configuration</h3>}
  
  Deploying your OP Stack contracts require creating a deployment configuration
  JSON file. This defines the behavior of your network at its genesis.

  *   [Rollup Configuration Documentation](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/rollup)

  {<h3>Batcher Configuration</h3>}

  The batcher is the service that submits the L2 Sequencer data to L1, to make
  it available for verifiers. These configurations determine the batcher's 
  behavior.

  *   [Batcher Configuration Documentation](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/batcher)

  {<h3>Proposer Configuration</h3>}

  The proposer is the service that submits the output roots to the L1. These
  configurations determine the proposer's behavior.

  *   [Proposer Configuration Documentation](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/proposer)

  {<h3>Node Configuration</h3>}

  The rollup node has a wide array of configurations for both the consensus and
  execution clients.
