# Rollup Configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a JSON file inside the
Optimism repository. You can see example configurations in the
[deploy-config directory](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config).


<Callout type="warning">
  The Rollup configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve
  significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your
  configuration, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/genesis/config.go).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Standard configuration is the set of requirements for an OP Stack chain to be
  considered a Standard Chain within the superchain. These requirements are 
  currently a draft, pending governance approval. For more details, please see
  this [governance thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135).

for constraining the sequencer's ability to re-order transactions; higher 
values would pose a risk to user protections.

*   **Notes:** Must not be `address(0)`

### systemConfigStartBlock

SystemConfigStartBlock represents the block at which the op-node should start
syncing from. It is an override to set this value on legacy networks where it
is not set by default. It can be removed once all networks have this value set
in their storage.

*   **Type:** L2 Block Number
*   **Default value:** None
*   **Standard Config Requirement:** The block where the SystemConfig was 
initialized.
