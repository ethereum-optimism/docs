# Rollup deployment configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a deployment 
configuration JSON file inside that is passed into the smart contract 
[deployment script](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol).
You can see example deployment configuration files in the
[deploy-config directory](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config).
This document highlights the deployment configurations and their values.

<Callout type="warning">
  The Rollup configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve
  significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your
  configuration, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/genesis/config.go).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Standard configuration is the set of requirements for an OP Stack chain to be
  considered a Standard Chain within the Superchain. These requirements are
  currently a draft, pending governance approval. For more details, please see
  this [governance thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135)
  and the actual requirements in the [OP Stack Configurability Specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html).

`keccak256(bytes32(chainId))[:19]`, where || denotes concatenation, 
`versionByte` is `0x00`, and `chainId` is a `uint256`.
This is to cover the full range of chain ids, to the full `uint256` size. 
Here's how you can get this address:
    ```solidity
    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes32(uint256(chainId)))); 
    # [:19] means taking the first 19 bytes of the hash
    # then preppending a version byte of zero: 0x00
    # `0x00{hash[:19]}`
    ```
