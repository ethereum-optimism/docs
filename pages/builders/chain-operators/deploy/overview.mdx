# OP Stack Deployment Overview

When deploying an OP Stack chain, you'll be setting up four different
components. It's useful to understand what each of these components does before
you start deploying your chain. The OP Stack can be deployed as a L3, which
includes additional considerations. The following information assumes you're
deploying a L2 Rollup on Ethereum.

## Smart Contracts

The OP Stack uses a set of smart contracts on the L1 blockchain to manage
aspects of the Rollup. Each OP Stack chain has its own set of L1 smart
contracts that are deployed when the chain is created.

<Callout type="warning">
  Standard OP Stack chains should only use governance approved and audited
  smart contracts. The monorepo has them tagged with the following pattern
  `op-contracts/vX.X.X` and you can review the release notes for details on the
  changes. Read more about the details on our [Smart Contract Release Section](/stack/protocol/rollup/smart-contracts#releases).
</Callout>

## Sequencer Node

OP Stack chains use a Sequencer node to gather proposed transactions from users
and publish them to the L1 blockchain. OP Stack chains rely on at least one of
these Sequencer nodes. You can also run additional replica (non-Sequencer)
nodes.

### Consensus Client

OP Stack Rollup nodes, like Ethereum nodes, have a consensus client. The
consensus client is responsible for determining the list and ordering of blocks
and transactions that are part of your blockchain. Several implementations of
the OP Stack consensus client exist, including `op-node` (maintained by the
Optimism Foundation), [`magi`](https://github.com/a16z/magi) (maintained by
a16z) and [`hildr`](https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr) (maintained by OptimismJ).

### Execution Client

OP Stack nodes, like Ethereum nodes, also have an execution client. The
execution client is responsible for executing transactions and maintaining the
state of the blockchain. Various implementations of the OP Stack execution
client exist, including `op-geth` (maintained by Optimism Foundation),
[`op-erigon`](https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon)
(maintained by Test in Prod), and [`op-nethermind`](https://docs.nethermind.io/get-started/installing-nethermind/#supported-networks).

## Batcher

The Batcher is a service that publishes transactions from the Rollup to the L1
blockchain. The Batcher runs continuously alongside the Sequencer and publishes
The Batcher continuously publishes transactions alongside the Sequencer in regular batches.

## Proposer

The Proposer is a service responsible for publishing transactions *results* (in
the form of L2 state roots) to the L1 blockchain. This allows smart contracts
on L1 to read the state of the L2, which is necessary for cross-chain
communication and reconciliation between state changes.

## Software Dependencies

| Dependency                                                    | Version  | Version Check Command |

| [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)                                | `^20`    | `node --version`      |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `^8`     | `pnpm --version`      |

| [direnv](https://direnv.net)                                  | `^2`     | `direnv --version`    |

### Notes on Specific Dependencies

#### `node`

We recommend using the latest LTS version of Node.js (currently v20).
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a useful tool that can help you
manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine. You may experience
unexpected errors on older versions of Node.js.

#### `foundry`

It's recommended to use the scripts in the monorepo's `package.json` for
managing `foundry` to ensure you're always working with the correct version.
This approach simplifies the installation, update, and version checking
process.

#### `direnv`

Parts of our tutorial use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) as a way of loading
environment variables from `.envrc` files into your shell. This means you won't
have to manually export environment variables every time you want to use them.
`direnv` only ever has access to files that you explicitly allow it to see.

After [installing `direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html), you
will need to **make sure that [`direnv` is hooked into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)**.
Make sure you've followed [the guide on the `direnv` website](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html),
then **close your terminal and reopen it** so that the changes take effect (or
`source` your config file if you know how to do that).

<Callout>
  Make sure that you have correctly hooked `direnv` into your shell by modifying
  your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). If you haven't
  edited a config file then you probably haven't configured `direnv` properly
  (and things might not work later).
