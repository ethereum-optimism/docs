# OP Stack smart contract deployment

<Callout type="info">
  Standard OP Stack chains must use the latest governance approved and audited versions of the smart contract code.
</Callout>

The following guide shows you how to deploy the OP Stack L1 smart contracts.
The primary development branch is `develop`, however **you should only deploy
official contract releases**. You can visit the see the [smart contract overview](/stack/smart-contracts#official-releases)
for the official release versions. Changes to the smart contracts are
generally not considered backwards compatible.

<Callout type="warning">
  The following deployment information outlines the legacy method for deploying the OP Stack L1 contracts.
  This method is not recommended and is provided only for historical context.
</Callout>

## Deployment configuration

To deploy OP Stack contracts, you need to create a deployment configuration JSON file.
The file should be placed in the following monorepo subdirectory: [packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config).

For a detailed explanation of the configuration options and their meanings, refer to the [rollup deployment configuration page](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/rollup).

## Deployment script (Legacy method)

The legacy method for deploying smart contracts uses [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs) and the deployment script located in the monorepo at
[packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol).

### State diff

You can verify the state diff before deploying the contracts by using the `runWithStateDiff()` function in the deployment script.
This produces outputs in [`snapshots/state-diff/`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/snapshots/state-diff).
Run the deployment with state diffs using the following command:

```bash
forge script -vvv scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --sig 'runWithStateDiff()' --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Execution

*   Set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` and add the `--verify` flag to verify your
    contracts.
*   `DEPLOYMENT_OUTFILE` will determine the filepath that the deployment
    artifact is written to on disk after the deployment. It comes in the form of a
    JSON file where keys are the names of the contracts and the values are the
    addresses the contract was deployed to.
*   `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH` is the path on the filesystem that points to a deployment
    config. The same deployment config JSON file should be used for L1 contracts
    deployment as when generating the L2 genesis allocs. See the [deploy-config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config)
    directory for examples and the [rollup configuration page](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/rollup)
    for descriptions of the values.
*   `IMPL_SALT` env var can be used to set the create2 salt for deploying the
    implementation contracts.

This will deploy an entire new system of L1 smart contracts, including a new
SuperchainConfig. In the future, there will be an easy way to deploy only
proxies and use shared implementations for each of the contracts as well as a
shared SuperchainConfig contract.

```
DEPLOYMENT_OUTFILE=deployments/artifact.json \
DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH=<PATH_TO_MY_DEPLOY_CONFIG> \
  forge script scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL
```

### Deploying a single contract

All functions for deploying a single contract are public, meaning that
the `--sig` argument to forge script can be used to target the deployment of a
single contract.

## Using `op-deployer`

The recommended way to deploy the L1 smart contracts is with the `op-deployer` tool.
Follow the steps in this [section](/builders/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup#using-op-deployer) to learn how it works.

## Best practices

Production users should deploy their L1 contracts from a contracts release.
All contracts releases are on git tags with the following format:
`op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`. If you're deploying a new standard chain, you should
deploy the [Fault Proof Fixes release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.6.0) with the permissioned game type
enabled.
Starting with permissioned fault proofs gives chain operators time to get comfortable
running the additional infrastructure requirements: [op-challenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-challenger) and
[monitoring](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/tree/main). There are also
additional changes to the economics of operating a permissionless fault proof that chain
operators should have a firm understanding of.
