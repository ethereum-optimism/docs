# Deterministic Deployment Preinstalls

This guide explains deterministic deployment preinstalls and its benefits for developers.
Deterministic deployment preinstalls is a feature that provides certain core contracts to be already deployed across all chains at launch, saving countless hours for developers.
Without this feature, new chain developers experienced difficulties when trying to deploy anything to production because of missing core contracts that could take several weeks to deploy (even longer for smaller chains).

Deterministic deployment preinstalls solves this problem by deploying smart contracts at their appropriate addresses in the L2 genesis state to ensure that these do not need to be redeployed after each OP Stack chain launches.
This feature also helps the Superchain to standardize on particularly highly used smart contracts, so developers can assume these contracts will exist on any remote domain.

<Callout type="info">
  Deterministic deployment preinstalls will be automatic for all new OP chains after XXX. If you are an existing OP chain, follow [this process](#implementation-for-existing-op-chains) or use Bindgen to [add your own preinstalls](#how-to-add-your-own-preinstalls-bindgen).

## Contracts and Rationale

## Implementation for Existing OP Chains

Seems like there are 2 groups of contracts (safe contracts with different versions so diff steps for devs to take) and then all other contracts. Need to find a way to explain.

### Step 1: Deploy Safe Contracts

Safe contracts include `Safe`, `SafeL2`, `MultiSend`, and `MultiSendCallOnly` and `Safe Singleton Factory` which are going to be `v1.3.0` or `v1.4.1`.

For existing OP chains that don't have `v1.3.0` of the contracts deployed, choose ONE of the following options:

*   Option 1: Deploy [https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy) to each OP chain. **NOTE**: Requires support of pre EIP-155 transactions.
*   Option 2: Follow the [singleton deployment process](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/tree/main#how-to-get-the-singleton-deployed-to-your-network) for Safe Singleton Factory
*   Option 3: Hardfork in [https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy) and/or Safe Singleton Factory for each OP chain

**OR**

For existing OP chains on `v1.4.1` without Safe Singleton Factory, choose ONE of the following options:

*   Option 1: Follow the [singleton deployment process](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/tree/main#how-to-get-the-singleton-deployed-to-your-network) for Safe Singleton Factory
*   Option 2: Hardfork in [https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy) and/or Safe Singleton Factory for each OP chain

### Step 2: Deploy Other Contracts

Existing OP chains will need to deploy the following contracts, in addition to the safe contracts discussed above.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Safe Singleton Factory</h3>}

  This contract is already deployed to OP, BASE, and ZORA.
  For other existing OP chains that don't have it, the following pre-signed transaction can be submitted to deploy the contract at the deterministic address `0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c`.

  {<h3>MultiCall3</h3>}

  This contract is already deployed to OP, BASE, and ZORA.
  For other existing OP chains that don't have it, the following pre-signed transaction can be submitted to deploy the contract at the deterministic address `0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11`.

  {<h3>create2deployer</h3>}

  This contract is already deployed to OP and ZORA. For other existing OP chains that don't have it, there doesn't seem to be a pre-signed transaction available, meaning there are two options to deploy the contract at the address `0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2`:

  1.  Request `pcaversaccio` (the private key owner) to sign transactions (for each OP chain) to deploy
  2.  Hardfork the contract into each OP chain

  <Callout type="warning">
    BASE deployment [requires hardfork](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/create2deployer/issues/128).
  </Callout>

  {<h3>permit2</h3>}

  This contract is already deployed to OP and BASE. For other existing OP chains that don't have it, there doesn't seem to be a pre-signed transaction available, meaning there are two options to deploy the contract at the address `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3`:

  1.  Request Uniswap (or whomever has the original deployer private key) to sign transactions (for each OP chain) to deploy
  2.  Hardfork the contract into each OP chain

  {<h3>ERC-4337 Entry Point `v0.6.0`</h3>}

  This contract is already deployed to OP, BASE, and ZORA. For other existing OP chains that don't have it, there doesn't seem to be a pre-signed transaction available, meaning there are two options to deploy the contract at the address `0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789`:

  1.  Contact the original deployer
  2.  Hardfork the contract into each OP chain

  <Callout type="warning">
    `SenderCreator` Dependency:

    *   `EntryPoint` [deploys](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/abff2aca61a8f0934e533d0d352978055fddbd96/contracts/core/EntryPoint.sol#L26) `SenderCreator` upon initialization, so it's required that `SenderCreator` be added as a preinstall for `EntryPoint` to work as intended.
    *   The deployed bytecode at `0x7fc98430eaedbb6070b35b39d798725049088348` on ETH mainnet is being used for the preinstall.
  </Callout>
