# Chain Operator Best Practices

The following information has some best practices around running the OP Stack's
off-chain components.

## Correct Release Versions

Chain and node operators should always run the latest production releases of
the OP Stack's off chain components. Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs
can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases)
and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases).

*   Production releases are always tags, versioned as
    `<component-name>/v<semver>`. For example, an `op-node` release might be
    versioned as `op-node/v1.7.5`.
*   Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.7.7`, indicate releases of all
    Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
*   In the monorepo, this means these `v<semver>` releases contain all `op-*`
    components, and exclude all `contracts-*` components.
*   `op-geth` embeds upstream geth's version inside its own version as follows:
    `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`. Basically, geth's version is
    our minor version. For example, if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding
    `op-geth` version would be `v1.101200.0`. Note that we pad out to three
    characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch
    version. Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not
    padded.

## Incremental Upgrade Rollouts 

When upgrading your nodes, take a staggered approach. This means deploying the
upgrade gradually across your infrastructure and ensuring things work as
expected before making changes to every node.

## Isolate Your Sequencer 

You can isolate your sequencer node, by not connecting it directly to the
internet. Instead, you could handle your ingress traffic behind a proxy. Have 
the proxy forward traffic to replicas and have them gossip the transactions 
internally.
