# Chain Configuration

The OP Stack is a flexible platform with various configuration values that you can tweak to fit your specific needs. If you're looking to fine-tune your OP Stack chain deployment, look no further.

<Callout type="warning">
  Work in Progress

  OP Stack configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your configuration, check back with this page to see if anything has changed.
</Callout>

## New Blockchain Configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a JSON file inside the Optimism repository. The file is `<optimism repository>/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/<chain name>.json`. For example, [this is the configuration file for the tutorial blockchain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/getting-started.json).

#### Setting your `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval`

<Callout type="warning">
  **If you don't submit batches within the sequencer window, the chain will reorg.**
  A reorg this large impacts the user experience because all transactions from the past 12 hours will be wiped, and this may require full node operators to re-sync from genesis.
</Callout>

When deploying your contracts, you can set the `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval` to any value you wish to save on costs (e.g., 24 hours or 12 hours). On OP mainnet, `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval` is set to `1800 L2 blocks = 1 hr`.
The tradeoff here is that users will only be able to prove withdrawals after an output root is posted, so users will have to submit their L2 withdrawal transaction, wait up to the number of hours in the submission interval, then prove on L1, then wait 1 week, then finalize.

<Callout type="info">
  After fault proofs are shipped to Mainnet, output roots can be submitted as infrequently as you wish, and there won't be a submission interval anymore.
</Callout>

### Governance token

The governance token is a side-effect of use of the OP Stack in the OP Mainnet network. It may not be included by default in future releases.

| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `governanceTokenOwner`  | L2 Address | Address that will own the token contract deployed by default to every OP Stack based chain. |               |
| `governanceTokenSymbol` | String     | Symbol for the token deployed by default to each OP Stack chain.                            | OP            |
| `governanceTokenName`   | String     | Name for the token deployed by default to each OP Stack chain.                              | Optimism      |

### OP-Batcher Configuration

The `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` is configurable, see the section below for guidance.

| Key                               | Type                | Description                                                                                               | Default value |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` | Number of L1 Blocks | The max time (in L1 blocks, which are 12 seconds each) between which batches will be submitted to the L1. | 1500          |

<Callout>
  The default value inside `op-batcher`, if not specified, is still `0`, which means channel duration tracking is disabled.
  For very low throughput chains, this would mean to fill channels until close to the sequencing window and post the channel to `L1 SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN` L1 blocks before the sequencing window expires.
</Callout>

#### Setting your  `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION`

To minimize costs, we recommend setting your  `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` to target 5 hours, with a value of `1500` L1 blocks. When non-zero, this parameter is the max time (in L1 blocks, which are 12 seconds each) between which batches will be submitted to the L1. If you have this set to 5 for example, then your batcher will send a batch to the L1 every 5\*12=60 seconds. When using blobs, because 130kb blobs need to be purchased in full, if your chain doesn't generate at least \~130kb of data in those 60 seconds, then you'll be posting only partially full blobs and wasting storage.

*   We do not recommend setting any values higher than targeting 5 hours, as batches have to be submitted within the sequencing window which defaults to 12 hours for OP chains, otherwise your chain may experience a 12 hour long chain reorg. 5 hours is the longest length of time we recommend that still sits snugly within that 12 hour window to avoid affecting stability.
*   If your chain fills up full blobs of data before the `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` elapses, a batch will be submitted anyways - (e.g. even if the OP Mainnet batcher sets an `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` of 5 hours, it will still be submitting batches every few minutes)

<Callout type="warning">
  While setting an`OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` of `1500` results in the cheapest fees, it also means that your [safe head](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/glossary.md#safe-l2-head) can stall for up to 5 hours.

  *   This will negatively impact apps on your chain that rely on the safe head for operation. While many apps can likely operate simply by following the unsafe head, often Centralized Exchanges or third party bridges wait until transactions are marked safe before processing deposits and withdrawal.
  *   Thus a larger gap between posting batches can result in significant delays in the operation of certain types of high-security applications.
