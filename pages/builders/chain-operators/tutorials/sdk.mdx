# Using the OP Stack Client SDK

This tutorial explains how to use the OP Stack Client SDK when working with native and non-native supported chains.

*   [The OP Stack Client SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io/) *natively* supports multiple OP Chains: OP, Base, etc. To see whether a specific OP Chain is supported directly, [see the documentation](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid).
*   If you are using a chain that is *not* natively supported, for example an OP Stack chain [you just created](/stack/getting-started), you can continue to use [the OP Stack Client SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io/).
    You just need to provide some contract addresses to the `CrossDomainMessenger` because they aren't preconfigured. This tutorial walks you through that process.

## Before You Begin

To configure the `CrossDomainMessenger`, you'll first need to locate the L1 contract addresses and specify the zero address for unused SDK contracts.

### L1 contract addresses

If you followed the directions in [Getting Started](/stack/getting-started), the contract addresses are in `.../optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments`, which you created when you deployed the L1 contracts.

| Contract name when creating `CrossDomainMessenger` | File with address                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `AddressManager`                                   | `Lib_AddressManager.json`                |
| `L1CrossDomainMessenger`                           | `Proxy__OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.json` |
| `L1StandardBridge`                                 | `Proxy__OVM_L1StandardBridge.json`       |
| `OptimismPortal`                                   | `OptimismPortalProxy.json`               |
| `L2OutputOracle`                                   | `L2OutputOracleProxy.json`               |

### SDK contract addresses

Some contracts are required by the SDK as a sanity check, but are not actually used.
For these contracts you can just specify the zero address:

*   `StateCommitmentChain`
*   `CanonicalTransactionChain`
*   `BondManager`

In JavaScript you can create the zero address using the expression `"0x".padEnd(42, "0")`.

## Create the `CrossChainMessenger` Object

These directions assume you are inside the [Hardhat console](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/hardhat-console).
They further assume that your project already includes the Optimism SDK [`@eth-optimism/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/sdk).

<Steps>
  ### Import the SDK

  ```js
  optimismSDK = require("@eth-optimism/sdk")
  ```

  ### Set the configuration parameters

  | Variable name | Value                                                                                      |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `l1Url`       | URL to an RPC provider for L1, for example `https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/<api key>` |
  | `l2Url`       | URL to your OP Stack. If running on the same computer, it is `http://localhost:8545`       |
  | `privKey`     | The private key for an account that has some ETH on the L1                                 |

  ### Create the [providers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/) and [signers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/)

  ```js
  l1Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(l1Url)
  l2Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(l2Url)
  l1Signer = new ethers.Wallet(privKey).connect(l1Provider)
  l2Signer = new ethers.Wallet(privKey).connect(l2Provider)
  ```

  ### Create the L1 contracts structure

  ```js
  zeroAddr = "0x".padEnd(42, "0")
  l1Contracts = {
     StateCommitmentChain: zeroAddr,
     CanonicalTransactionChain: zeroAddr,
     BondManager: zeroAddr,
     // These contracts have the addresses you found out earlier.
     AddressManager: "0x....",   // Lib_AddressManager.json
     L1CrossDomainMessenger: "0x....",   // Proxy__OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.json  
     L1StandardBridge: "0x....",   // Proxy__OVM_L1StandardBridge.json
     OptimismPortal: "0x....",   // OptimismPortalProxy.json
     L2OutputOracle: "0x....",   // L2OutputOracleProxy.json
  }                       
  ```

  ### Create the data structure for the standard bridge

  ```js
   bridges = { 
     Standard: { 
        l1Bridge: l1Contracts.L1StandardBridge, 
        l2Bridge: "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010", 
        Adapter: optimismSDK.StandardBridgeAdapter
     },
     ETH: {
        l1Bridge: l1Contracts.L1StandardBridge, 
        l2Bridge: "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010", 
        Adapter: optimismSDK.ETHBridgeAdapter
     }
  }
  ```

  ### Create the [`CrossChainMessenger`](https://sdk.optimism.io/classes/crosschainmessenger) object

  ```js
  crossChainMessenger = new optimismSDK.CrossChainMessenger({
     bedrock: true,
     contracts: {
        l1: l1Contracts
     },
     bridges: bridges,
     l1ChainId: await l1Signer.getChainId(),
     l2ChainId: await l2Signer.getChainId(),
     l1SignerOrProvider: l1Signer,
     l2SignerOrProvider: l2Signer,    
  })
  ```
</Steps>

## Verify SDK Functionality

To verify the SDK's functionality, transfer some ETH from L1 to L2.

<Steps>
  ### Get the current balances

  ```js
  balances0 = [
     await l1Provider.getBalance(l1Signer.address),
     await l2Provider.getBalance(l1Signer.address)
  ]
  ```

  ### Transfer 1 gwei

  ```js
  tx = await crossChainMessenger.depositETH(1e9)
  rcpt = await tx.wait()
  ```

  ### Get the balances after the transfer

  ```js
  balances1 = [
     await l1Provider.getBalance(l1Signer.address),
     await l2Provider.getBalance(l1Signer.address)
  ]
  ```

  ### See that the L1 balance changed

  It probably changed by a lot more than 1 gwei because of the cost of the transaction.

  ```js
  (balances0[0]-balances1[0])/1e9
  ```

  ### See that the L2 balance changed

  This process might take a few minutes.

  ```js
  ((await l2Provider.getBalance(l1Signer.address))-balances0[1])/1e9
  ```
</Steps>

That's it! You're all set! ðŸŽ‰
