# Using the Optimism SDK

This tutorial will walk you through the process of using the [Optimism SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io) to interact with your OP Stack chain.
The Optimism SDK **natively** supports various OP Chains including OP Mainnet and Base.
To check whether your OP Chain is already supported, [see the Optimism SDK docs](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid).

<Callout type="info">
You will need to already have created your own OP Stack chain to follow this tutorial.
Check out the tutorial on [Creating Your Own L2 Rollup Testnet](./create-l2-rollup) if you haven't done so already.
</Callout>

## Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
*   [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

## Find Contract Addresses

You will need to find the addresses for a number of smart contracts that are part of your OP Stack chain in order to use the Optimism SDK.
If you followed the instructions in the [Creating Your Own L2 Rollup Testnet](./create-l2-rollup) tutorial, you can find the addresses by looking at the JSON artifacts within the directory `optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/getting-started`.

Simply run the following command from inside the directory `optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock` to print the list of addresses you'll need:

```bash
./scripts/print-addresses.sh getting-started --sdk
```

<Callout>
Make sure you have [`jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) installed when running this command.
</Callout>

You should see output similar to the following:

```text
AddressManager: 0x...
L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy: 0x...
L1StandardBridgeProxy: 0x...
L2OutputOracleProxy: 0x...
OptimismPortalProxy: 0x...
```

Save these addresses somewhere so you can use them in the next section.

## Create a Demo Project

You're going to use the Optimism SDK for this tutorial.
Since the Optimism SDK is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library, you'll need to create a Node.js project to use it.

<Steps>
{<h3>Make a Project Folder</h3>}

```bash
mkdir op-sdk-sample-project
cd op-sdk-sample-project
```

{<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>}

```bash
pnpm init
```

{<h3>Install the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add @eth-optimism/sdk
```

{<h3>Install ethers.js</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add ethers@^5
```
</Steps>

## Start the Node REPL

You're going to use the Node REPL to interact with the Optimism SDK.
To start the Node REPL run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node
```

This will bring up a Node REPL prompt that allows you to run javascript code.

## Import Dependencies

You need to import some dependencies into your Node REPL session.

<Steps>

{<h3>Import the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L3 hash=26b2fdb17dd6c8326a54ec51f0769528
```

{<h3>Import ethers.js</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L4 hash=69a65ef97862612e4978b8563e6dbe3a
```

</Steps>

## Set Session Variables

You'll need a few variables throughout this tutorial.
Let's set those up now.

<Steps>

{<h3>Create the RPC providers</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L6-L7 hash=53fc69364fffe9faa00ab558446cbe13
```

{<h3>Set the contract addresses</h3>}

Using the addresses you accessed earlier, set the contract addresses in the following variables:

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L9-L13 hash=c32c35e3e6eebb1b3c9c68dece1cb93f
```

{<h3>Set the chain IDs</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L15-L16 hash=f33189a08efe81f43a03bbc4a6812a1a
```

</Steps>

## Initialize the Optimism SDK

You can now create an instance of the `CrossChainMessenger` object from the Optimism SDK.
This will allow you to easily handle cross-domain messages between L1 and L2.

Simply create the object:

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-stack.js#L18-L39 hash=216bd2437a5893704acfad2c768b9544
```

Note that you've passed in the RPC providers you created earlier, the addresses of the smart contracts you deployed, and the chain ID of your OP Stack chain.

## Next Steps

You can now use the SDK to interact with your OP Stack chain just like you would with other chains like OP Mainnet.
See existing tutorials, like the tutorial on [Bridging ETH With the Optimism SDK](/builders/dapp-developers/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth) or [Bridging ERC-20 Tokens With the Optimism SDK](/builders/dapp-developers/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20), for examples of how to use the Optimism SDK.
