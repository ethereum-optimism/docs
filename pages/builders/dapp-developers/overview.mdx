# Dapp Developer Overview

This document provides an overview of tools and resources to help you build applications for OP Mainnet. It points you to guides on basic contract deployment, cross-chain messaging, and [Dapp developer tutorials](#dapp-developer-tutorials).
If you're looking for third-party tools that make building apps on OP Mainnet easier, check out the [Developer Tools](/builders/tools/overview) section.

## Getting Started

If you're brand new to OP Mainnet, try starting with the guide on [deploying a basic contract](/chain/getting-started).
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Luckily, OP Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), so it's similar to deploying a contract to Ethereum with a [few small differences](/chain/differences).

You might also want to check out the [testing on OP Networks guide](/chain/testing/testing-dapps) and the tutorial on [running a local development environment](/chain/testing/dev-node) to help you feel totally confident in your OP Mainnet deployment.

## Cross-Chain Messaging

Looking to explore cross-chain messaging? Here are some detailed guides for that.
If you want to bridge a token from Ethereum to OP Mainnet (or vice versa!), you should check out the [Standard Token Bridge](bridging/standard-bridge).
The Standard Token Bridge makes the process of moving tokens between chains as easy as possible.

If you're looking for something more advanced, take a look at the guide on [sending data between L1 and L2](bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, it's pretty cool!
OP Mainnet even uses this same message-passing infrastructure under the hood of the Standard Token Bridge.

## Dapp Developer Tutorials

If you're a bit more familiar with OP Mainnet and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the tutorials put together by the Optimism community.
They'll help you get a headstart when building your first Optimistic project.
