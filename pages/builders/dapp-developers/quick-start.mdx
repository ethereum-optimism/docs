# 15-Minute Quick Start Guide

This 15-min quick start guide walks you through an easy two-step process to deploy an app to any OP Chain.

## Step 1: Get Test ETH from Superchain Faucet

You'll need some test ETH on OP Sepolia to pay for the [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) associated with deploying your test application.
Use the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) to get some free ETH on OP Sepolia for multiple OP Chains with just one click.
You can request test ETH from the Superchain Faucet in one of two ways: **connect a wallet** or **login with Github**.

If you **connect a wallet**, you can get up to 1 test ETH per network every 24 hours. If you **login with Github**, you can get up to 0.05 Test ETH per day.

  You can also try using [other available OP Sepolia faucets](/builders/tools/build/faucets).

## Step 2: Build a Basic App with the Starter Kit

The [Optimism Starter Kit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter) helps you quickly deploy an app to any OP Chain. It runs viem under the hood and automatically verifies and publishes contract code to the block explorer for you.

### Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

<Steps>
  {<h3>Get an Etherscan key</h3>}

  *   Register for [Etherscan on Optimism](https://explorer.optimism.io/register). This account is different from your normal Etherscan account.
  *   Go to the [API keys page](https://explorer.optimism.io/myapikey) and click **Add** to create a new API key.

  {<h3>Set up the Environment</h3>}

  You will first need to set up your `.env` to tell Forge where to deploy your contract.

  1.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

      ```sh
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

  2.  Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables.

      *   `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Your Etherscan API Key.

      *   `FORGE_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the network to which you deploy.
          If you use [Alchemy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/ecosystem/alchemy), your URL will look like this: `https://opt-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/<Alchemy API Key>`

      *   `FORGE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the wallet you want to deploy from.

      *   `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: WalletConnect v2 requires a project ID. You can obtain it from your WC dashboard: [https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id)

  {<h3>Start the application</h3>}

  1.  Clone/fork the optimism-starter repo

      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter.git
      ```

  2.  Install the necessary node packages:

      ```sh
      cd optimism-starter
      npm install
      ```

  3.  Start the frontend with `npm run dev`

      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```

      If you get errors during this step, you might need to [update your Foundry to the latest version](#install-foundry).

  4.  Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

      Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/App.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.

{<h3>Generate ABIs & React Hooks</h3>}

This project comes with `@wagmi/cli` built-in, which means you can generate wagmi-compatible (type safe) ABIs & React Hooks straight from the command line.

To generate ABIs & React Hooks from your Foundry project (in `./contracts`), you can run:

```sh
npm run wagmi
```

This will use the wagmi config (`wagmi.config.ts`) to generate a `src/generated.ts` file which will include your ABIs & Hooks that you can start using in your project.

[Here is an example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/src/components/Attestoooooor.tsx#L77) of Hooks from the generated file being used.

{<h3>Deploy Contracts</h3>} 

To deploy your contracts to a network, you can use Foundry's [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) – a command-line tool to tests, build, and deploy your smart contracts.

You can read a more in-depth guide on using Forge to deploy a smart contract [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying), but we have included a simple script in the `package.json` to get you started.

To deploy a smart contract to Ethereum Mainnet using Forge, run:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

</Steps>
Congratulations! You now have an OP Mainnet app ready for development. 🎉

## Next Steps
*   Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/README.md#developing-with-anvil-optimism-mainnet-fork) if you'd like to develop using Anvil, for an Optimism Mainnet Fork.
*   If you're looking to build your app using alternatives such as NEXT.js or a burner wallet, then [check out this resource](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/README.md#alternatives).
*   Visit the [dapp developer tutorials](overview#tutorials) for guided walk-thrus on how to add bridging, wallet features, and L1-to-L2 transactions.
