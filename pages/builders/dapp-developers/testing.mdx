# Testing on OP Test Networks

You can find the chainid and supporting information for OP Goerli, our test network, [using these endpoints](/chain/networks).
To obtain ETH and tokens (both ERC-20 and NFT) from faucets, [see here](/builders/tools/faucets).

This page shows some additional testing utilities that you might find useful.

## ERC-20 tokens

We have several ERC-20 testing token contracts.
This token is an implementation of ERC-20, with the addition of `faucet`, a function that mints for the caller 1000 tokens to facilitate testing.

Additionally, both OP Mainnet and OP Goerli have [WETH at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006`](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/4417948883611-What-is-ETH-WETH-How-do-they-interact-).

### Goerli ERC-20 testing contracts

## The bridge

The `OUTb` token is supported by the bridge on Goerli.
See [this tutorial](/builders/dapp-developers/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20) to see how to use it.

## ERC-721 tokens

We have an ERC-721 token on OP Goerli at address [`0x38abA480f2bA7A17bC01EE5E1AD64fCedd93EfE7`](https://goerli-explorer.optimism.io/address/0x38abA480f2bA7A17bC01EE5E1AD64fCedd93EfE7).
It is the OpenZeppelin ERC-721 token contract with the addition of `faucet`.
Just call the `faucet` function to get as many NFT tokens as you need.
