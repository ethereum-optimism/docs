# Bridging ETH to OP Mainnet With the Optimism SDK

This tutorial explains how you can use the [Optimism SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io) to bridge ETH from L1 (Ethereum or Sepolia) to L2 (OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia).
The Optimism SDK is an easy way to add bridging functionality to your javascript-based application.
It also provides some safety rails to prevent common mistakes that could cause ETH or ERC-20 tokens to be made inaccessible.

Behind the scenes, the Optimism SDK uses the [Standard Bridge](/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) contracts to transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens.
Make sure to check out the [Standard Bridge guide](/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) if you want to learn more about how the bridge works under the hood.

## Supported Networks

The Optimism SDK supports any of the [Superchain networks](/chain/networks).
[Some Superchain networks](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid) are already included in the SDK by default.
If you want to use a network that isn't included by default you can simply [instantiate the SDK with the appropriate contract addresses](/builders/chain-operators/tutorials/sdk).

## Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Create a Demo Project

You're going to use the Optimism SDK for this tutorial.
Since the Optimism SDK is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library, you'll need to create a Node.js project to use it.

<Steps>
{<h3>Make a Project Folder</h3>}

```bash
mkdir op-sdk-sample-project
cd op-sdk-sample-project
```

{<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>}

```bash
pnpm init
```

{<h3>Install the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add @eth-optimism/sdk
```

{<h3>Install ethers.js</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add ethers@^5
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Want to create a new wallet for this tutorial?
If you have [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed you can run `cast wallet new` in your terminal to create a new wallet and get the private key.
</Callout>

## Get ETH on Sepolia

This tutorial explains how to bridge ETH from Sepolia to OP Sepolia.
You will need to get some ETH on Sepolia to follow along.

<Callout type="info">
You can use [this faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com) to get ETH on Sepolia.
</Callout>

## Add a Private Key to Your Environment

You need a private key in order to sign transactions.
Set your private key as an environment variable with the `export` command.
Make sure this private key corresponds to an address that has ETH on Sepolia.

```bash
export TUTORIAL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Start the Node REPL

You're going to use the Node REPL to interact with the Optimism SDK.
To start the Node REPL run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node
```

This will bring up a Node REPL prompt that allows you to run javascript code.

## Import Dependencies

You need to import some dependencies into your Node REPL session.

<Steps>

{<h3>Import the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L3 hash=26b2fdb17dd6c8326a54ec51f0769528
```

{<h3>Import ethers.js</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L4 hash=69a65ef97862612e4978b8563e6dbe3a
```

</Steps>

## Set Session Variables

You'll need a few variables throughout this tutorial.
Let's set those up now.

<Steps>

{<h3>Load your private key</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20.js#L6 hash=755b77a7ffc7dfdc186f36c37d3d847a
```

{<h3>Create the RPC providers and wallets</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L8-L11 hash=9afdce50665ae93bce602068071ffaa1
```

</Steps>

## Get ETH

You're going to need some ETH on L1 that you can bridge to L2.
You can get some Sepolia ETH from [this faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com).

## Deposit ETH

Now that you have some ETH on L1 you can deposit that ETH into the `L1StandardBridge` contract.
You'll then receive the same number of ETH on L2 in return.

<Steps>

{<h3>Check your wallet balance on L1</h3>}

See how much ETH you have on L1 so you can confirm that the deposit worked later on.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L14 hash=3be1dd9a6019e9f59ad6fab38e168e99
```

{<h3>Create a CrossChainMessenger instance</h3>}

The Optimism SDK exports a `CrossChainMessenger` class that makes it easy to interact with the `L1StandardBridge` contract.

Create an instance of the `CrossChainMessenger` class:

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L16-L21 hash=997b9c4cdd5fb1f9d4e0882a683ae016
```
{<h3>Deposit your ETH</h3>}

Now you can deposit your ETH into the Standard Bridge contract.
You'll deposit a small amount of ETH just to demonstrate the process.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L24-L25 hash=8bd6fdfe984274e8ec2368dc735118b4
```

{<h3>Wait for the deposit to be relayed</h3>}

You can use the `waitForMessageStatus` function to wait for the deposit to be relayed to L2.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L28 hash=659971675ab8d53bc2bd5196f72c873b
```

{<h3>Check your wallet balance on L1</h3>}

You should now have less ETH on L1.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L31 hash=3be1dd9a6019e9f59ad6fab38e168e99
```

{<h3>Check your wallet balance on L2</h3>}

You should now have more ETH on L2.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L34 hash=7884641849eab1590b148118d709f0fd
```

</Steps>

## Withdraw ETH

You just bridged some ETH from L1 to L2.
Nice!
Now you're going to repeat the process in reverse to bridge some ETH from L2 to L1.

<Steps>

{<h3>Start your withdrawal on L2</h3>}

The first step to withdrawing ETH from L2 to L1 is to start the withdrawal on L2.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L37-L38 hash=e9880eb7e7e95253637b5b88a4772074
```

{<h3>Check your wallet balance on L2</h3>}

You should now have less ETH on L2, but your wallet balance on L1 will not have changed yet.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L41 hash=7884641849eab1590b148118d709f0fd
```

{<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is ready to prove</h3>}

The second step to withdrawing ETH from L2 to L1 is to prove to the bridge on L1 that the withdrawal happened on L2.
You first need to wait until the withdrawal is ready to prove.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L44 hash=e8b55ec0f16f90ba4d4197cf47ff8e6d
```

<Callout type="info">
This step can take a few minutes.
Feel free to take a quick break while you wait.
</Callout>

{<h3>Prove the withdrawal on L1</h3>}

Once the withdrawal is ready to be proven, you'll send an L1 transaction to prove that the withdrawal happened on L2.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L47 hash=fee5f5e924472ee9daceb681ccae1cb9
```

{<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is ready for relay</h3>}

The final step to withdrawing ETH from L2 to L1 is to relay the withdrawal on L1.
This can only happen after the fault proof period has elapsed.
On OP Sepolia, this is only a few seconds.
On OP Mainnet, this takes 7 days.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L50 hash=55a41ac5586b8a688ffd6dfbb20f2d15
```

{<h3>Relay the withdrawal on L1</h3>}

Once the withdrawal is ready to be relayed you can finally complete the withdrawal process.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L66 hash=f8d30944dad1664d82b9fdf14da59f9e
```

{<h3>Wait until the withdrawal is relayed</h3>}

Now you simply wait until the message is relayed.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L69 hash=c2c14a739c44011a058e9848a0019f15
```

{<h3>Check your wallet balance on L1</h3>}

You should now have more ETH on L1.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth.js#L72 hash=3be1dd9a6019e9f59ad6fab38e168e99
```

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congrats!
You've just deposited and withdrawn ETH using the Optimism SDK.
You should now be able to write applications that use the Optimism SDK to transfer ETH between L1 and L2.
Although this tutorial used Sepolia and OP Sepolia, the same process works for Ethereum and OP Mainnet.
