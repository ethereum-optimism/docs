# Viewing Deposits and Withdrawals by Address

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the [Optimism SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io) to view all of the [Standard Bridge](../bridging/standard-bridge) deposits and withdrawals triggered by a given address.

<Callout>
Check out the tutorial on [Bridging ERC-20 Tokens With the Optimism SDK](./cross-dom-bridge-erc20) to learn how to create deposits and withdrawals.
</Callout>

## Dependencies

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Create a Demo Project

You're going to use the Optimism SDK for this tutorial.
Since the Optimism SDK is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library, you'll need to create a Node.js project to use it.

<Steps>

{<h3>Make a Project Folder</h3>}

```bash
mkdir op-sdk-sample-project
cd op-sdk-sample-project
```

{<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>}

```bash
pnpm init
```

{<h3>Install the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add @eth-optimism/sdk
```

{<h3>Install ethers.js</h3>}

```bash
pnpm add ethers@^5
```

</Steps>

## Add RPC URLs to Your Environment

You'll be using the `getDepositsByAddress` and `getWithdrawalsByAddress` functions from the Optimism SDK during this tutorial.
These functions use event queries to retrieve the deposits and withdrawals made by a given address.
Since these functions use large event queries, you'll need to use an RPC provider like [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) that supports indexed event queries.
Grab an L1 and L2 RPC URL for Sepolia and OP Sepolia, respectively.

```bash
export L1_RPC_URL=... # Sepolia RPC URL
export L2_RPC_URL=... # OP Sepolia RPC URL
```

<Callout>
The Optimism SDK may be updated in the future to use a different method of retrieving deposits and withdrawals under the hood that does not require indexed event queries.
This tutorial will be updated to reflect those changes if and when they occur.
</Callout>

## Start the Node REPL

You're going to use the Node REPL to interact with the Optimism SDK.
To start the Node REPL run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node
```

This will bring up a Node REPL prompt that allows you to run javascript code.

## Import Dependencies

You need to import some dependencies into your Node REPL session.

<Steps>

{<h3>Import the Optimism SDK</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L3 hash=26b2fdb17dd6c8326a54ec51f0769528
```

{<h3>Import ethers.js</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L4 hash=69a65ef97862612e4978b8563e6dbe3a
```

</Steps>

## Set Session Variables

You'll need a few variables throughout this tutorial.
Let's set those up now.

<Steps>

{<h3>Import RPC URLs</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L10-L11 hash=02141d8cb077764665c61fc48e18ed04
```

{<h3>Set the address to query</h3>}

Here you'll be querying over an address that has already made some deposits and withdrawals.
You can replace this address with your own address if you'd like.

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L14 hash=2d71bc03a4b3a3942fecdaf8a66f4a27
```

{<h3>Create the RPC providers</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L16-L17 hash=e86efaea1d4adde679ca66911080dc28
```

</Steps>

## Create the CrossDomainMessenger

The Optimism SDK exports a `CrossChainMessenger` class that makes it easy to interact with the Standard Bridge contracts.

Create an instance of the `CrossChainMessenger` class:

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L19-L24 hash=158c6888c82bdc2f07c37c3edb3a9a6a
```

## Query for Deposits

You'll first query for all of the deposits made by the target address.
The `CrossChainMessenger` has a convenient function called `getDepositsByAddress` that makes this easy.

<Steps>

{<h3>Grab all deposits</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L27 hash=feaa2a2fb5fb75c58ace54aaad6cfac4
```

{<h3>Display the deposits</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L30-L37 hash=116d4986989b6019d516cb5ee7960c07
```

</Steps>

## Query for Withdrawals

You'll next query for all of the withdrawals made by the target address.
The `CrossChainMessenger` has a convenient function called `getWithdrawalsByAddress` that makes this easy.

<Steps>

{<h3>Grab all withdrawals</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L40 hash=264c31c31103dff9aeaec9640365faae
```

{<h3>Display the withdrawals</h3>}

```js file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/sdk-view-txns.js#L43-L50 hash=f47dbeb2048e5fdf2665e8f3e07bf6c8
```

</Steps>
