# Node Metrics and Monitoring

The Optimism `op-node` exposes a variety of metrics to help observe the health of the system and debug issues. Metrics are formatted for use with Prometheus and exposed via a metrics endpoint. The default metrics endpoint is `http://localhost:7300/metrics`.

To enable metrics, pass the `--metrics.enabled` flag to the `op-node`. You can customize the metrics port and address via the `--metrics.port` and `--metrics.addr` flags, respectively.

## Important Metrics

To monitor the health of your node, you should monitor the following metrics:

*   `op_node_default_refs_number`: This metric represents the `op-node`'s current L1/L2 reference block number for different sync types. If it stops increasing, it means that the node is not syncing. If it goes backwards, it means your node is reorging.
*   `op_node_default_peer_count`: This metric represents how many peers the `op-node` is connected to. Without peers, the `op-node` cannot sync unsafe blocks and your node will lag behind the sequencer as it will fall back to syncing purely from L1.
*   `op_node_default_rpc_client_request_duration_seconds`: This metrics measures the latency of RPC requests initiated by the `op-node`. This metric is important when debugging sync performance, as it will reveal which specific RPC calls are slowing down sync. This metric exposes one timeseries per RPC method. The most important RPC methods to monitor are:
    *   `engine_forkChoiceUpdatedV1`, `engine_getPayloadV1`, and `engine_newPayloadV1`: These methods are used to execute blocks on `op-geth`. If these methods are slow, it means that sync time is bottlenecked by either `op-geth` itself or your connection to it.
    *   `eth_getBlockByHash`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber`: These methods are used by the `op-node` to fetch transaction data from L1. If these methods are slow, it means that sync time is bottlenecked by your L1 RPC.

## Available Metrics

A complete list of available metrics is below:
