# Network Upgrade Overview

<Callout type="warning">
  Read this [notice](/builders/notices/fjord-changes.mdx) to prepare for Fjord.
</Callout>

This section has information on how to upgrade your Mainnet and Testnet nodes
for new network upgrades. The network upgrade naming scheme after the Bedrock
upgrade has a geology themed name based on the next letter in the english
alphabet.

## Activations

Network upgrades are activated by timestamps. Failing to upgrade your node
before the timestamp will cause a chain divergence. You will need to resync
your node to reconcile the chain. Optimistic activation times refer to times
that are pending governance approval.

    (also known as `L1Block` predeploy)

### [Delta](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html#delta)

The Delta upgrade consists of a single consensus-layer feature: [Span Batches](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/delta/span-batches.html).

The Delta upgrade uses a *L2 block-timestamp* activation-rule, and is specified only in the rollup-node (`delta_time`).

### [Canyon](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html#canyon)

The Canyon upgrade contains the Shapella upgrade from L1 and some minor protocol fixes.

*   [EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651)
*   [EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855)

The Canyon upgrade uses a *L2 block-timestamp* activation-rule, and is specified in both the
rollup-node (`canyon_time`) and execution engine (`config.canyonTime`). Shanghai time in the
execution engine should be set to the same time as the Canyon time.

## Upgrade Process

Network upgrades follow this general process in which the features included in
the upgrade are put into a release version cut from the `develop` branch and
then the software is deployed on production networks.

<Callout type="info">
  "Baking" on a network means the node software has been deployed and is live.
  Engineers take this time to observe the behavior of the software on
  production networks.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Devnet

  *   `Devnet Upgrade Notice Period` is for core developers to upgrade the
      node software on an internal devnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Devnet`
  *   `Baking on Devnet`

  ### Testnet

  *   `Testnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow testnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on testnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Testnet`
  *   `Baking on Testnet`

  ### Mainnet

  *   `Governance Voting Review Period` is when the Optimism Collective's
      governance system reviews proposals, including network upgrade proposals.
  *   `Governance Voting Period` is when the Optimism Collective's governance
      system votes on proposals.
  *   `Veto Period` is when the Citizens' House of the governance system can
      veto a protocol upgrade that has been approved by the Token House.
  *   `Cut Mainnet Release`
  *   `Mainnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow mainnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on mainnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activated`
</Steps>
