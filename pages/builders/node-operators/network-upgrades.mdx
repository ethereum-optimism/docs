# Network Upgrade Overview

This section has information on how to upgrade your Mainnet and Testnet nodes
for new network upgrades. The network upgrade naming scheme after the Bedrock
upgrade has a geology themed name based on the next letter in the english
alphabet.

## Activations

Network upgrades are activated by timestamps. Failing to upgrade your node
before the timestamp will cause a chain divergence. You will need to resync
your node to reconcile the chain. Optimistic activation times refer to times
that are pending governance approval.

## Summary of Changes

These are the summaries of each network upgrade changes ordered by the most 
recent activation. These are a reflection of the [Superchain Upgrades Specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html)

### [Granite](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/granite/overview.html)

    (also known as `L1Block` predeploy)

### [Delta](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/delta/overview.html)

The Delta upgrade consists of a single consensus-layer feature: [Span Batches](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/delta/span-batches.html).

The Delta upgrade uses a *L2 block-timestamp* activation-rule, and is specified only in the rollup-node (`delta_time`).

### [Canyon](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/canyon/overview.html)

The Canyon upgrade contains the Shapella upgrade from L1 and some minor protocol fixes.

*   [EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651)
*   [EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855)

*   [Withdrawals are prohibited in P2P Blocks](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/rollup-node-p2p.html#block-validation)
*   [Withdrawals should be set to the empty array with Canyon](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/derivation.html#building-individual-payload-attributes)
*   [EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049)
*   [Modifies the EIP-1559 Denominator](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/exec-engine.html#1559-parameters)
*   [Channel Ordering Fix](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/derivation.html#reading)
*   [Adds the deposit nonce & deposit nonce version to the deposit receipt hash](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/deposits.html#deposit-receipt)
*   [Deploys the create2Deployer to `0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2`](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/predeploys.html#create2deployer)

The Canyon upgrade uses a *L2 block-timestamp* activation-rule, and is specified in both the
rollup-node (`canyon_time`) and execution engine (`config.canyonTime`). Shanghai time in the
execution engine should be set to the same time as the Canyon time.

## Upgrade Process

Network upgrades follow this general process in which the features included in
the upgrade are put into a release version cut from the `develop` branch and
then the software is deployed on production networks.

<Callout type="info">
  "Baking" on a network means the node software has been deployed and is live.
  Engineers take this time to observe the behavior of the software on
  production networks.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Devnet

  *   `Devnet Upgrade Notice Period` is for core developers to upgrade the
      node software on an internal devnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Devnet`
  *   `Baking on Devnet`

  ### Testnet

  *   `Testnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow testnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on testnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Testnet`
  *   `Baking on Testnet`

  ### Mainnet

  *   `Governance Voting Review Period` is when the Optimism Collective's
      governance system reviews proposals, including network upgrade proposals.
  *   `Governance Voting Period` is when the Optimism Collective's governance
      system votes on proposals.
  *   `Veto Period` is when the Citizens' House of the governance system can
      veto a protocol upgrade that has been approved by the Token House.
  *   `Cut Mainnet Release`
  *   `Mainnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow mainnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on mainnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activated`
</Steps>
