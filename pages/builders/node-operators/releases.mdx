# Node software releases

This page gives information on the off chain node software release information.

<Callout type="info">
  Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases)
  and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases).
</Callout>

## Production releases

Chain and node operators should always run the latest production releases of the OP Stack's off-chain components. Production releases are always tags, versioned as `<component-name>/v<semver>`. For example, an `op-node` release might be versioned as `op-node/v1.7.5`. Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.7.6`, indicate releases of all Go code only and DO NOT include smart contracts. This naming scheme is required by Golang. In the above list, these `v<semver>` releases contain all `op-*` components and exclude all `contracts-*` components.

`op-geth` embeds upstream geth's version inside its own version as follows: `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`. Basically, geth's version is our minor version. For example, if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding `op-geth` version would be `v1.101200.0`. Note that we pad out to three characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch version. Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not padded.

### Docker images

To make it easier to find and use our Docker images, each release entry below provides links to the corresponding Docker images:

*   **op-node**: Docker images can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/op-node/tags).
*   **op-geth**: Docker images can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereumoptimism/op-geth/tags).

### Example Docker image tags

We follow a consistent tagging convention to make it easier to find the right image. Here are some examples:

*   `optimism/op-node:<version>`
*   `optimism/op-geth:<version>`
