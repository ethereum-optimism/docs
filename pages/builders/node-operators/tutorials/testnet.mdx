# Running an OP Sepolia Node from Source

This tutorial explains how to run an OP Sepolia node from source code.
Running an OP Sepolia node from source code is a flexible alternative to using pre-built Docker images.

## Building the Source Code

You'll need to build `op-node` and `op-geth` from their respective source repositories before you can run a node.
Make sure to follow the instructions on [Building a Node from Source](./node-from-source) before continuing.

## Hardware Requirements

Hardware requirements for OP Sepolia nodes can vary depending on the type of node you plan to run.
Archive nodes generally require significantly more resources than full nodes.
Below are suggested minimum hardware requirements for each type of node.

*   16GB RAM
*   1TB SSD (full node) or 2TB SSD (archive node)
*   Reasonably modern CPU

## Initialize the Data Directory

Unlike OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia does not require a migrated data directory.
Instead, like with Ethereum, you'll simply need to initialize the data directory with the OP Sepolia genesis file.

<Callout>
The genesis file is **not required** for nodes using [snap sync](/builders/node-operators/management/snap-sync), so modified instructions are provided at that step.
</Callout>

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the op-geth directory</h3>}

Find and enter the directory where you built `op-geth` from source.

{<h3>Download the genesis file</h3>}

*   For nodes using snap sync: Set `--op-network=op-sepolia` flag on `op-geth`
*   For all other nodes: download the genesis file from the OP Sepolia networks page

```bash
curl -o op-sepolia-genesis.json -sL https://networks.optimism.io/op-sepolia/genesis.json
```

{<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DATADIR_PATH=... # Path to the folder where geth data will be stored
```

{<h3>Initialize the data directory</h3>}

Initialize the data directory with the genesis file.

```bash
geth init --datadir=$DATADIR op-sepolia-genesis.json
```

</Steps>

## Assess Blob Archiver

Assess if you need to configure a blob archiver service by reading the 
[Configure a Blob Archiver documentation](/builders/node-operators/management/blobs#configure-a-blob-archiver-archive-nodes).

## Create a JWT Secret

`op-geth` and `op-node` communicate over the engine API authrpc.
This communication is secured using a shared secret.
You will need to generate a shared secret and provide it to both `op-geth` and `op-node` when you start them.
In this case, the secret takes the form of a 32 byte hex string.

Run the following command to generate a random 32 byte hex string:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

## Start `op-geth`

It's generally easier to start `op-geth` before starting `op-node`.
You can still start `op-geth` without yet running `op-node`, but the `op-geth` instance will simply not receive any blocks until `op-node` is started.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to your op-geth directory</h3>}

Find the directory where you built the `op-geth` binary.

{<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-geth` directory.

```bash
cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
```

{<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

Set the following environment variables (if not already set):

```bash
export DATADIR_PATH=... # Path to the folder where geth data will be stored
```

{<h3>Start op-geth</h3>}

Use the following command to start `op-geth` in a default configuration.
The JSON-RPC API will become available on port 8545.
Refer to the `op-geth` [configuration documentation](../management/configuration#op-geth) for more detailed information about available options.

```bash
./build/bin/geth \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://sepolia-sequencer.optimism.io/ \
  --nodiscover \
  --syncmode=full \
  --maxpeers=0 \
  --op-network=op-sepolia \
  --datadir=$DATADIR_PATH
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-node`

Once you've started `op-geth`, you can start `op-node`.
`op-node` will connect to `op-geth` and begin synchronizing the OP Sepolia state.
`op-node` will begin sending block payloads to `op-geth` when it derives enough blocks from Sepolia.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to your op-node directory</h3>}

Find the directory where you built the `op-node` binary.

{<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

Both `op-geth` and `op-node` need to use the same JWT secret.
Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-node` directory.

```bash
cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
```

{<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export L1_RPC_URL=...  # URL for the L1 node to sync from
export L1_RPC_KIND=... # RPC type (alchemy, quicknode, infura, parity, nethermind, debug_geth, erigon, basic, any)
export L1_BEACON_URL=... # URL address for the L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use.
```

{<h3>Start op-node</h3>}

Use the following command to start `op-node` in a default configuration.
Refer to the `op-node` [configuration documentation](../management/configuration#op-node) for more detailed information about available options.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `op-node` RPC should not be exposed publicly. If left exposed, it could
  accidentally expose admin controls to the public internet.
</Callout>

```bash
./bin/op-node \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
  --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
  --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --network=op-sepolia \
  --rpc.addr=127.0.0.1 \
  --rpc.port=8547
```

<Callout>
Some L1 nodes, like Erigon, do not support the `eth_getProof` RPC method that the `op-node` uses to load L1 data for certain processing steps.
If you are using an L1 node that does not support `eth_getProof`, you will need to include the `--l1.trustrpc` flag when starting `op-node`.
Note that this flag will cause `op-node` to trust the L1 node to provide correct data as it will no longer be able to independently verify the data it receives.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Synchronization

Once you've started `op-geth` and `op-node` you should see the two begin to communicate with each other and synchronize the OP Sepolia chain.
Initial synchronization can take several hours to complete.

During this time, you will initially observe `op-node` deriving blocks from Sepolia without sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
This means that `op-node` is requesting blocks from Sepolia one-by-one and determining the corresponding OP Sepolia blocks that were published to Sepolia.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|13:31:20.389] Advancing bq origin                      origin=17171d..1bc69b:8300332 originBehind=false
```

Once the `op-node` has derived enough blocks from Sepolia, it will begin sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Sync progress                            reason="processed safe block derived from L1" l2_finalized=ef93e6..e0f367:4067805 l2_safe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_unsafe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_time=1,673,564,096 l1_derived=6079cd..be4231:8301091

```

You should then also begin to see logs like the following from `op-geth`:

```text

```
