# Running an OP Sepolia Node from Source

This tutorial explains how to run an OP Sepolia node from source code.
Running an OP Sepolia node from source code is a flexible alternative to using pre-built Docker images.

## Building the Source Code

You'll need to build `op-node` and `op-geth` from their respective source repositories before you can run a node.
Make sure to follow the instructions on [Building a Node from Source](./node-from-source) before continuing.

## Hardware Requirements

Hardware requirements for OP Sepolia nodes can vary depending on the type of node you plan to run.
Archive nodes generally require significantly more resources than full nodes.
Below are suggested minimum hardware requirements for each type of node.

*   8GB RAM
*   60 GB SSD (full node) or 200 GB SSD (archive node)
*   Reasonably modern CPU

## Assess Blob Archiver

Assess if you need to configure a blob archiver service by reading the 
[Configure a Blob Archiver documentation](/builders/node-operators/management/blobs#configure-a-blob-archiver-archive-nodes).

## Create a JWT Secret

`op-geth` and `op-node` communicate over the engine API authrpc.
This communication is secured using a shared secret.
You will need to generate a shared secret and provide it to both `op-geth` and `op-node` when you start them.
In this case, the secret takes the form of a 32 byte hex string.

Run the following command to generate a random 32 byte hex string:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

## Start `op-geth`

It's generally easier to start `op-geth` before starting `op-node`.
You can still start `op-geth` without yet running `op-node`, but the `op-geth` instance will simply not receive any blocks until `op-node` is started.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to your op-geth directory</h3>}

Find the directory where you built the `op-geth` binary.

{<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-geth` directory.

```bash
cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
```

{<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

Set the following environment variables (if not already set):

```bash
export DATADIR_PATH=... # Path to the folder where geth data will be stored
```

{<h3>Start op-geth</h3>}

Use the following command to start `op-geth` in a default configuration.
The JSON-RPC API will become available on port 8545.
Refer to the `op-geth` [configuration documentation](/builders/node-operators/configuration/execution-config) for more detailed information about available options.

<Callout type="info"> 
*   Set `--syncmode=execution-layer` on `op-node` if you don't set `--syncmode=full` here on op-geth.
*   For archive nodes, set `--syncmode=full` and `--gcmode=archive` on `op-geth`. 
*   The default settings are for full nodes.
</Callout>

```bash
./build/bin/geth \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://sepolia-sequencer.optimism.io/ \
  --op-network=op-sepolia \
  --datadir=$DATADIR_PATH
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-node`

Once you've started `op-geth`, you can start `op-node`.
`op-node` will connect to `op-geth` and begin synchronizing the OP Sepolia state.
`op-node` will begin sending block payloads to `op-geth` when it derives enough blocks from Sepolia.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to your op-node directory</h3>}

Find the directory where you built the `op-node` binary.

{<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

Both `op-geth` and `op-node` need to use the same JWT secret.
Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-node` directory.

```bash
cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
```

{<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export L1_RPC_URL=...  # URL for the L1 node to sync from. If your L1 RPC is a local node, the most common URL is http://127.0.0.1:8545
export L1_RPC_KIND=... # RPC type (alchemy, quicknode, infura, parity, nethermind, debug_geth, erigon, basic, any)
export L1_BEACON_URL=... # URL address for the L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use. If your L1 Beacon is a local node, the most common URL is http://127.0.0.1:3500
```

{<h3>Start op-node</h3>}

Use the following command to start `op-node` in a default configuration.
Refer to the `op-node` [configuration documentation](/builders/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config) for more detailed information about available options.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `op-node` RPC should not be exposed publicly. If left exposed, it could
  accidentally expose admin controls to the public internet.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Sync mode is set to `--syncmode=execution-layer` to enable [snap sync](/builders/node-operators/management/snap-sync).
</Callout>

```bash
./bin/op-node \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
  --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
  --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --network=op-sepolia \
  --syncmode=execution-layer
```

<Callout>
Some L1 nodes, like Erigon, do not support the `eth_getProof` RPC method that the `op-node` uses to load L1 data for certain processing steps.
If you are using an L1 node that does not support `eth_getProof`, you will need to include the `--l1.trustrpc` flag when starting `op-node`.
Note that this flag will cause `op-node` to trust the L1 node to provide correct data as it will no longer be able to independently verify the data it receives.
</Callout>

</Steps>

### Synchronization Verification

Once you've started `op-geth` and `op-node` you should see the two begin to 
communicate with each other and synchronize the OP Mainnet chain.

#### Snap Sync (Default)

Initial synchronization can take several hours to complete. You will see these 
`op-node` logs at the start of snap sync:

```text
INFO [03-06|10:56:55.602] Starting EL sync
INFO [03-06|10:56:55.615] Sync progress                            reason="unsafe payload from sequencer while in EL sync" l2_finalized=000000..000000:0 l2_safe=000000..000000:0 l2_pending_safe=000000..000000:0 l2_unsafe=4284ab..7e7e84:117076319 l2_time=1,709,751,415 l1_derived=000000..000000:0
INFO [03-06|10:56:57.567] Optimistically inserting unsafe L2 execution payload to drive EL sync id=4ac160..df4d12:117076320
```

`Starting EL sync` is shown once and the **sync progress / inserting logs** should be repeated until done.

`op-node` will log the following when done:

```text
lvl=info msg="Finished EL sync" sync_duration=23h25m0.370558429s finalized_block=0x4f69e83ff1407f2e2882f2526ee8a154ac326590799889cede3af04a7742f18d:116817417
```

There are two stages on `op-geth` for snap sync:

<Steps>
  {<h3>Downloading the headers</h3>}
  `op-geth` log something like this as it is downloading the headers:

  ```text
  lvl=info msg="Syncing beacon headers" downloaded=116775778 left=1162878 eta=53.182s 
  ```

  {<h3>Sync progress</h3>}  

  For the second stage, `op-geth` will log the following:

  ```text
  lvl=info msg="Syncing: state download in progress" synced=99.75% state="191.33 GiB" accounts=124,983,227@25.62GiB slots=806,829,266@165.16GiB codes=78965@566.74MiB eta=-2m7.602s
  ```

  ```text
  msg="Syncing: chain download in progress" synced=100.00% chain="176.01 GiB" headers=116,817,399@45.82GiB bodies=116,817,286@52.87GiB receipts=116,817,286@77.32GiB eta=77.430ms
  ```
  
  All the while, `op-geth` will also log the forkchoice update:

  ```text
  Forkchoice requested sync to new head  number=117,076,468 hash=e3884c..bf4e2b
  ```

</Steps>

#### Full Sync

Initial full synchronization can take several days to complete.

During this time, you will initially observe `op-node` deriving blocks from Ethereum without sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
This means that `op-node` is requesting blocks from Ethereum one-by-one and determining the corresponding OP Mainnet blocks that were published to Ethereum.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|13:31:20.389] Advancing bq origin                      origin=17171d..1bc69b:8300332 originBehind=false
```

Once the `op-node` has derived enough blocks from Ethereum, it will begin sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Sync progress                            reason="processed safe block derived from L1" l2_finalized=ef93e6..e0f367:4067805 l2_safe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_unsafe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_time=1,673,564,096 l1_derived=6079cd..be4231:8301091
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Found next batch                         epoch=8e8a03..11a6de:8301087 batch_epoch=8301087 batch_timestamp=1,673,564,098
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.461] generated attributes in payload queue    txs=1  timestamp=1,673,564,098
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.463] inserted block                           hash=e80dc4..72a759 number=4,068,015 state_root=660ced..043025 timestamp=1,673,564,098 parent=7fe3f6..900127 prev_randao=78e43d..36f07a fee_recipient=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011 txs=1  update_safe=true
```

You should then also begin to see logs like the following from `op-geth`:

```text
INFO [06-26|14:02:12.974] Imported new potential chain segment     number=4,068,194 hash=a334a0..609a83 blocks=1         txs=1         mgas=0.000  elapsed=1.482ms     mgasps=0.000   age=5mo2w20h dirty=2.31MiB

```
