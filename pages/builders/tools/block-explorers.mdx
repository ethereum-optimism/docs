# Block Explorers

This reference guide lists different block explorers you can use to interact with contract source code and view transaction history for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia.

<Callout type="info">
Please visit the community [Block Explorers page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/blob/main/community/tools/block-explorers.md) for a listing of third-party block explorers being used or built by the Optimism developer community.

## Access to Pre-Regenesis History

Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).
However, you **can** access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using a number of different tools. For detailed instructions, see [Regenesis History](/builders/tools/regenesis-history).
