# Account Abstraction

[ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/paymasters/introduction), also known as Account Abstraction, enables more opportunities for apps and wallet developers to innovate on user experiences, including the ability to:

*   Batch transactions together (e.g. approve and execute a swap in one go)
*   Offer wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase
*   Sponsor the gas fees for transactions
*   Enable users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice

## Superchain paymaster

The Superchain paymaster is an ERC-4337 verifying paymaster that sponsors transactions for smart accounts on the Superchain. Use the Superchain Paymaster to get your transactions sponsored to remove friction from your app experience. [View the implementation guide and tutorials here.](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/tree/main/docs/superchain-paymaster)

## Account Abstraction Tools

Ready to enable account abstraction experiences in your app? Here's some helpful information on account abstraction infrastructure like ERC-4337 bundler and gas manager APIs that are available on OP Mainnet:

*   [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/account-abstraction): 
    Account Kit is a complete solution for account abstraction. Using Account Kit, you can create a smart contract wallet for every user that leverages account abstraction to simplify every step of your app's onboarding experience. It also offers Gas Manager and Bundler APIs for sponsoring gas and batching transactions.

*   [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/): is an Account Abstraction toolkit that enables you to provide the simplest UX for your app or wallet. It offers modular smart accounts, as well as paymasters and bundlers as a service for sponsoring gas and executing transactions at scale.

*   [GroupOS](https://docs.groupos.xyz/introduction/group-os): provides Smart Wallets that are ERC-4337 compliant smart wallets, offering full flexibility, programmability and extensibility as well as out-of-the-box toolkit groups need to gaslessly onboard and activate wallets to games, applications, and/or protocols.

*    [Openfort](https://openfort.xyz): helps games and gamified experiences across onbaord an integrate wallet abstractions with simple APIs. The platform vertically integrates the AA stack, so game developers can focus on game development without worrying about private key management, the account model or the onchain interactions with paymasters and bundlers.

*   [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/): provides an infrastructure platform that makes building smart accounts simpler. If you are developing, an ERC-4337 smart account, they provide bundlers, verifying paymasters, ERC-20 paymasters, and much more.

*   [Safe](https://docs.safe.global/home/what-is-safe): provides modular smart account infrastructure and account abstraction stack via their Safe\{Core\} Account Abstraction SDK, API, and Protocol.

*   [Stackup](https://docs.stackup.sh/docs): provides smart account tooling for building account abstraction within your apps. They offer Paymaster and Bundler APIs for sponsoring gas and sending account abstraction transactions.
