# Account Abstraction

[ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/paymasters/introduction), also known as Account Abstraction, enables more opportunities for apps and wallet developers to innovate on user experiences, including the ability to:

*   Batch transactions together (e.g. approve and execute a swap in one go)
*   Offer wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase
*   Sponsor the gas fees for transactions
*   Enable users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice

## Superchain paymaster

The Superchain paymaster is an ERC-4337 verifying paymaster that sponsors transactions for smart accounts on the Superchain. Use the Superchain Paymaster to get your transactions sponsored to remove friction from your app experience. [View the implementation guide and tutorials here.](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/tree/main/docs/superchain-paymaster)
