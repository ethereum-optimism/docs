# Account abstraction

<Callout type="default">
  This page includes providers that meet specific [inclusion criteria](#inclusion-criteria), as outlined below.
</Callout>

[ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/paymasters/introduction), also known as Account Abstraction, enables more opportunities for apps and wallet developers to innovate on user experiences, including the ability to:

*   Batch transactions together (e.g. approve and execute a swap in one go)
*   Offer wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase
*   Sponsor the gas fees for transactions
*   Enable users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice

## Bundlers

The OP Stack includes support for the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` RPC method to assist bundlers on shared 4337 mempools. See the [specification](/stack/features/send-raw-transaction-conditional) for how this method is implemented in op-geth.

If used by the chain operator, also see the supplemental [op-txproxy](/builders/chain-operators/tools/op-txproxy) service which may apply additional restrictions prior to reaching the block builder.

<Callout type="info">
    As of today, this endpoint is not enabled by default in the stack. The operator must explicitly configure this.
</Callout>

## Superchain paymaster

The Superchain paymaster is an ERC-4337 verifying paymaster that sponsors transactions for smart accounts on the Superchain. Use the Superchain Paymaster to get your transactions sponsored to remove friction from your app experience. 

## Account abstraction tools

Ready to enable account abstraction experiences in your app? Here's some helpful information on account abstraction infrastructure like ERC-4337 bundler and gas manager APIs that are available on Metal L2:

*   [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/): is an Account Abstraction toolkit that enables you to provide the simplest UX for your app or wallet. It offers modular smart accounts, as well as paymasters and bundlers as a service for sponsoring gas and executing transactions at scale. See this [tutorial](/chain/biconomy) for trying Biconomy on the Metal L2 Testnet.

*   [thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/v5/account-abstraction/get-started?utm_source=opdocs&utm_medium=docs):
    offers the complete tool-kit to leverage account abstraction technology to enable seamless user experiences for your users. This includes Account Factory contracts that lets your users spin up Smart Accounts, Bundler for UserOps support, and Paymaster to enable gas sponsorships.
