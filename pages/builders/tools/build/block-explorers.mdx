# Block explorers

This reference guide lists different block explorers you can use to interact with contract source code and view transaction history for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia.

<Callout type="default">
This page includes providers that meet specific [inclusion criteria](#inclusion-criteria), as outlined below.

## Access to pre-regenesis history

Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).
However, you **can** access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using a number of different tools. For detailed instructions, see [Regenesis History](/builders/tools/monitor/regenesis-history).

## Inclusion criteria

Developer teams who want to feature products/tools on this page must meet the following criteria:

1.  **ongoing partnership** with Metal L2 whether formal agreement, RPGF, RFP, collaborated on specific initiatives, etc.;
2.  **established user base** and Metal L2 ecosystem engagement such as governance participation, homegrown TG or Discord participation, etc.; and
3.  **actively maintained developer tool** that aligns with Metal L2's commitment to a magical developer experience (e.g., easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate, great DevX, highly rated by community, etc.)
