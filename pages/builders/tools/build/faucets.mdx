# Testnet faucets

Faucets are developers tools that allow you to get free ETH (and other tokens) on test networks like Sepolia and OP Sepolia so that you can send transactions and create smart contracts.
Here you'll find a list of active faucets that you can try out.
Different faucets use different authentication methods, so you may have to try a few before you find one that works for you.
Faucets can occasionally also run out of ETH, so if you're having trouble getting ETH from a faucet, try another one.

<Callout type="default">
  This page includes providers that meet specific [inclusion criteria](#inclusion-criteria), as outlined below. Please visit the [community faucets page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/blob/main/community/tools/faucets.md) for an additional listing of third-party faucets.

  Tokens on test networks like Sepolia or OP Sepolia have no value and are only meant for testing.
  Metal L2 contributors only take what they need so that others can use faucets too!

## Superchain faucet

The [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) is a developer tool hosted by Optimism that allows developers to get free testnet ETH to test apps on testnet OP Chains like Base Sepolia, OP Sepolia, PGN Sepolia, Zora Sepolia, and other OP Chains in the Superchain.
The Superchain Faucet is a great place to start if you're looking for testnet ETH.

## Bridge from Sepolia

If you have testnet ETH on Sepolia, you can bridge it to OP Sepolia (and vice versa) using the [Superchain Bridges UI](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) or this collection of [Superchain Testnet Tools](https://www.superchain.tools/).
