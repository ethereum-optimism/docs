# Analytics Tools

The following guide lists platforms you can use to gather analytics and setup customizations about OP Mainnet.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) monitoring stack lets you [inspect any transaction execution on OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger#how-to-use-tenderly-debugger).

You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transaction's execution, as well as step into or over function calls.
The level of detail the Tenderly dashboard presents will reduce your development time as well as help you understand the execution flow of transactions.
It helps you to inspect states at every instance of transaction and gives a platform to trace transactions. You can also simulate pending (or any other historical) transactions and see their exact outcomes.
