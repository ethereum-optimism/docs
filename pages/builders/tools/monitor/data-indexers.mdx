# Data Indexers

Data indexing is essential for enabling your dApp to efficiently read blockchain data. While blockchains are designed for seamless data writing, reading data can be challengingâ€”especially when dealing with large volumes or requiring data transformation.

Below is a list of indexing providers that can help you index data for your smart contract on Optimism.

## Decentralized Providers

### The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol that provides an easy way to query blockchain data through APIs known as subgraphs.

With The Graph, you can benefit from:

*   Decentralized Indexing: Improves redundancy and query speed. Lets you eliminate any single point of failure.
*   GraphQL Queries: Provides a powerful GraphQL interface for querying indexed data, making data retrieval super simple.
*   Customization: Define your own logic for transforming & storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

Follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.
