# Developer Tools

Welcome to the Optimism developer tools!

If you are already familiar with [building on OP Mainnet](/chain/getting-started) and just need the tools to get cracking, you are in the right place!

## Connecting

You have the list of [networks](/chain/networks) and [node providers](/builders/tools/rpc-providers) to help you connect to an Optimism node.

## Deploying

To get some ETH bridged over for deployment gas fees, use one of the available [faucets](/builders/tools/faucets) or just bridge ETH using the [OP Mainnet Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/).

## Monitoring

We have a set of [block explorers](block-explorers) to help you provide a stellar service to your users. And, if your app is live in production, you can watch it grow using one of the [analytics tools](./analytics-tools).
