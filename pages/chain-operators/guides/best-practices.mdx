# Chain operator best practices

The following information has some best practices around running the OP Stack's
off-chain components.

## Correct release versions

Chain and node operators should always run the latest production releases of the OP Stack's off-chain components. The latest notes and changelogs can be found on GitHub:

*   [OP monorepo releases](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) (includes `op-node` and other Go-based OP components)
*   [op-geth releases](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases) (standalone repository)
*   [op-contracts releases](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) (look for tags starting with `op-contracts/`)

Some guidelines when picking versions:

*   **Production releases** are always tagged with `<component-name>/v<semver>` for a specific OP component, for example:
    *   `op-node/v1.7.5` for the `op-node`
    *   `op-challenger/v1.0.0` for the `op-challenger`

*   **Monorepo releases** typically use a simple `v<semver>` format (e.g. `v1.7.7`) to indicate that all Go-based OP Stack components (in `op-*`) have been updated together. These do **not** include new L1 contract releases.

*   **Contracts releases** are tagged under `op-contracts/v<semver>` (e.g. `op-contracts/v1.6.0`) and contain updates to the Bedrock L1 contracts.

*   **`op-geth` versioning** includes upstream geth's version within its semver. For example, if upstream geth is at `v1.12.0`, an `op-geth` release might be `v1.101200.0`. The geth major version is used as our minor version (left-padded if needed), and the patch version is appended.

Always consult release notes for additional details or upgrade instructions.

## Keep deployment artifacts

After deploying your contracts on Ethereum, you should keep a record of all the
deployment artifacts:

*   Contract release tag and commit hash
*   Contract deployment configuration file. This is the JSON file you created
    and passed to the deployment script when you deployed the contracts.
*   Contract deployment directory with smart contract artifacts. This is
    created in [packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments)
*   The rollup configuration file that you generated after the contract
    deployment
*   The genesis file that you generated after the contract deployment

## Incremental upgrade rollouts

When upgrading your nodes, take a staggered approach. This means deploying the
upgrade gradually across your infrastructure and ensuring things work as
expected before making changes to every node.

## Isolate your sequencer

You can isolate your sequencer node, by not connecting it directly to the
internet. Instead, you could handle your ingress traffic behind a proxy. Have
the proxy forward traffic to replicas and have them gossip the transactions
internally.

## Improve reliability of peer-to-peer transactions

These flags can improve the reliability of peer-to-peer transactions from internal replica nodes and the sequencer node.

For sequencer nodes:

```
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNAL: ""
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNALREMOTES: "false"
GETH_TXPOOL_NOLOCALS: "true"
```

For replica nodes:

```
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNALREMOTES: "true"
GETH_TXPOOL_LIFETIME: "1h"
GETH_TXPOOL_NOLOCALS: "true"
```

For additional information about these flags, check out our [Execution Layer Configuration Options](/operators/node-operators/configuration/execution-config) doc.

## Write your own runbooks

Create custom runbooks to prepare for operating an OP Stack chain. For a deeper understanding of daily operations and best practices, explore the public [OP Mainnet Runbooks](https://oplabs.notion.site/OP-Mainnet-Runbooks-120f153ee1628045b230d5cd3df79f63) to see how these practices could be applied to your own chain.

## Assumptions

### op-proposer assumes archive mode

The `op-proposer` currently assumes that `op-geth` is being run in archive
mode. This will likely be updated in a future network upgrade, but it is
necessary for L2 withdrawals at the moment.
