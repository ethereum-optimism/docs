# Privileged Roles in OP Stack Chains

OP Stack chains follow a [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://blog.oplabs.co/decentralization-roadmap/).
In their current state, OP Stack chains still include some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability to carry out specific actions.
Members and users of the Superchain Ecosystem should be aware of these roles and their associated risks because they're shared across many OP Stack chains.
Read this page to understand these roles, why they exist, and what risks they pose.

## L1 Proxy Admin

The L1 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Stack chains system contracts.

### Risks

*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

### Mitigations

*   L1 Proxy Admin owner is a 2-of-2 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A#readProxyContract). One owner is an Optimism Foundation 5/7 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92#readProxyContract) and the other owner is the [Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03#readProxyContract).

### Addresses

*   **Optimism Governed Chains on Ethereum**: [`0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A)
*   **Optimism Governed Chains on Sepolia:** [`0x1Eb2fFc903729a0F03966B917003800b145F56E2`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1Eb2fFc903729a0F03966B917003800b145F56E2)

## L2 Proxy Admin

The L2 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Stack chains system contracts on L2. The L2 Proxy Admin owner is the [aliased address](/stack/differences#address-aliasing) of the L1ProxyAdmin owner, which means the L2 ProxyAdmin Owner is equal to the L1 ProxyAdmin Owner, but due to aliasing it's a different address. Here's how that works:

*   Given an L1 contract address, the aliased L2 address is equal to `L1_contract_address` + `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`.
*   Using `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` as an example, the `0x6B` address is the L2 address that's been aliased, so to figure out the original L1 address you calculate `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` - `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`.
*   That result gives an L1 contract address of `0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A`, which should be the 2/2 Safe owned by Foundation + Security Council that is L1 ProxyAdmin Owner.
*   No one has the private key for `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` on OP Stack chains, which means the only way for the L2 ProxyAdmin owner to send transactions is via deposit transactions from the L1 `0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A` address.
*   For help with the calculations, see the [`AddressAliasHelper` library](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/vendor/AddressAliasHelper.sol).

### Risks

*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

### Mitigations

*   L2 Proxy Admin is controlled by the same L1 account as the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin). This is enabled by [address aliasing](/connect/resources/glossary#address-aliasing).

### Addresses

## System Config Owner

The System Config Owner is an address that can be used to change the values within the [`SystemConfig`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/62c7f3b05a70027b30054d4c8974f44000606fb7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/SystemConfig.sol) contract on Ethereum.

### Risks

*   Compromised System Config Owner could cause a temporary network outage.
*   Compromised System Config Owner could cause users to be overcharged for transactions.

### Mitigations

*   System Config Owner is a 5-of-7 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BA6e03D8B90dE867373Db8cF1A58d2F7F006b3A#readProxyContract).
*   System Config Owner may eventually be operated by a [Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885).
*   System Config Owner can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).

### Addresses

The System Config owner is chain specific and you can see which addresses are configured in the [Superchain Registry](/superchain/superchain-registry).

## Batcher

### Description

The Batcher is a software service that submits batches of transactions to Ethereum on behalf of the current OP Stack chains Sequencer.
OP Stack chains nodes will look for transactions from this address to find new batches of L2 transactions to process.

### Risks

*   Batcher address is typically a hot wallet.
*   Compromised batcher address can cause L2 reorgs or sequencer outages.

### Mitigations

*   Compromised batcher address cannot publish invalid transactions.
*   Compromised batcher address can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).

### Addresses

The batcher address is chain specific and you can see which addresses are configured in the [Superchain Registry](/superchain/superchain-registry).

## Proposer

### Description

The Proposer is a role that is allowed to create instances of the `PermissionedDisputeGame` dispute game type.
The `PermissionedDisputeGame` can be used as a fallback dispute game in the case that the `FaultDisputeGame` is found to include a critical security vulnerability.
The Guardian role is responsible for changing the respected dispute game type if necessary.

### Capabilities

*   Can create instances of the `PermissionedDisputeGame` dispute game type.
*   Can participate in the `PermissionedDisputeGame` dispute game process.

### Risks

*   Proposer address is typically a hot wallet.
*   Compromised proposer address could propose invalid state proposals.
*   Invalid state proposals can be used to execute invalid withdrawals after 7 days.

### Mitigations

*   Compromised proposer address can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).
*   Invalid state proposals can be challenged by the [Challenger](#challenger) within 7 days.

### Addresses

The proposer address is chain specific and you can see which addresses are configured in the [Superchain Registry](/superchain/superchain-registry).

## Challenger

### Description

The Challenger is an address that can participate in and challenge `PermissionedDisputeGame` instances created by the [Proposer](#proposer) role. It is important to note that this is different from the [`op-challenger`](/stack/fault-proofs/challenger) services that challenges invalid output roots.

### Capabilities

*   Can participate in the `PermissionedDisputeGame` dispute game process.

### Risks

*   Compromised challenger could invalidate valid state proposals.
*   Compromised challenger could fail to challenge invalid state proposals.

### Mitigations

*   Compromised challenger address can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).
*   Challenges can be executed by replaced challenger address.

## Guardian

### Description

The Guardian is an address that can be used to pause several system contracts on OP Stack chains.
This is a backup safety mechanism that allows for a temporary halt, particularly of withdrawal logic, in the event of a security concern.
The Guardian can also manage various aspects of the `OptimismPortal` contract to address active security concerns.

### Capabilities

*   Pause several system contracts on OP Stack chains.
*   Disable the ability for specific dispute game types from being used to execute withdrawals.
*   Disable the ability for specific dispute game instances from being used to execute withdrawals.

### Risks

*   Compromised guardian could pause withdrawals indefinitely.

### Mitigations

*   Compromised guardian address can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).
*   Withdrawals can be unpaused by replaced guardian address.

## Mint Manager Owner

The Mint Manager Owner is an address that controls the [`MintManager`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/62c7f3b05a70027b30054d4c8974f44000606fb7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/governance/MintManager.sol) contract that can be used to mint new OP tokens on OP Stack chains.

### Risks

*   Compromised Mint Manager Owner could mint arbitrary amounts of OP tokens.
*   Compromised Mint Manager Owner could prevent OP tokens from being minted.

### Mitigations

*   Mint Manager Owner is a 3-of-5 [multisig](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0x2a82ae142b2e62cb7d10b55e323acb1cab663a26#readProxyContract).
