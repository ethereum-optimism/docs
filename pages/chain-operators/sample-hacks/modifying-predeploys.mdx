OP Stack blockchains have a number of [predeployed contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/constants.ts) that provide important functionality.
Most of those contracts are proxies that can be upgraded using the `proxyAdminOwner` which was configured when the network was initially deployed.

The predeploys are controlled from a predeploy called [`ProxyAdmin`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol), whose address is `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000018`.
The function to call is [`upgrade(address,address)`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L205-L229).
The first parameter is the proxy to upgrade, and the second is the address of a new implementation.

For example, the legacy `L1BlockNumber` contract is at `0x420...013`.
To disable this function, we'll set the implementation to `0x00...00`.
We do this using the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) command `cast`.

1.  We'll need several constants.

    -   Set these addresses as variables in your terminal.

        ```sh
        L1BLOCKNUM=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000013
        PROXY_ADMIN=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000018
        ZERO_ADDR=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        ```

    -   Set `PRIVKEY` to the private key of your ADMIN account.

    -   Set `ETH_RPC_URL`. If you're on the computer that runs the blockchain, use this command.

        ```sh
        export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
        ```

2.  Verify `L1BlockNumber` works correctly.
    See that when you call the contract you get a block number, and twelve seconds later you get the next one (block time on L1 is twelve seconds).

    ```sh
    cast call $L1BLOCKNUM 'number()' | cast --to-dec
    sleep 12 && cast call $L1BLOCKNUM 'number()' | cast --to-dec
    ```

3.  Get the current implementation for the contract.

    ```sh
    L1BLOCKNUM_IMPLEMENTATION=`cast call $L1BLOCKNUM "implementation()" | sed 's/000000000000000000000000//'`
    echo $L1BLOCKNUM_IMPLEMENTATION 
    ```

4.  Change the implementation to the zero address

    ```sh
    cast send --private-key $PRIVKEY $PROXY_ADMIN "upgrade(address,address)" $L1BLOCKNUM $ZERO_ADDR
    ```

5.  See that the implementation is address zero, and that calling it fails.

    ```sh
    cast call $L1BLOCKNUM 'implementation()'
    cast call $L1BLOCKNUM 'number()'
    ```

6.  Fix the predeploy by returning it to the previous implementation, and verify it works.

    ```sh
    cast send --private-key $PRIVKEY $PROXY_ADMIN "upgrade(address,address)" $L1BLOCKNUM $L1BLOCKNUM_IMPLEMENTATION
    cast call $L1BLOCKNUM 'number()' | cast --to-dec
    ```
