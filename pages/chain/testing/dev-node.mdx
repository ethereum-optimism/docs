# Running a Local Development Environment

This tutorial teaches you how to setup and run a local development environment of the entire OP Mainnet system.

## What is this?

A development environment is a local installation of the entire OP Mainnet system.
Our default development environment includes both L1 and L2 development nodes.
Running the OP Mainnet environment locally is a great way to test your code and see how your contracts will behave on OP Mainnet before you graduate to a testnet deployment (and eventually a mainnet deployment).

Alternatively, you can get a hosted development node from [any of these providers](/builders/tools/connect/rpc-providers).

## Do I need this?

We generally recommend using the local development environment if your application falls into one of the following categories:

1.  **You're building contracts on both OP Mainnet and Ethereum that need to interact with one another.** The local development environment is a great way to quickly test interactions between L1 and L2. The OP Mainnet and test networks have a communication delay between L1 and L2 that can make testing slow during the early stages of development.

2.  **You're building an application that might be subject to one of the few [differences between Ethereum and OP Mainnet](/chain/differences).** Although OP Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), it's not exactly the same as Ethereum. If you're building an application that might be subject to one of these differences, you should use the local development environment to double check that everything is running as expected. You might otherwise have unexpected issues when you move to testnet. We strongly recommend reviewing these differences carefully to see if you might fall into this category.

However, not everyone will need to use the local development environment.
OP Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), which means that OP Mainnet looks almost exactly like Ethereum under the hood.
If you don't fall into one of the above categories, you can probably get away with simply relying on existing testing tools like Foundry or Hardhat.
If you don't know whether or not you should be using the development environment, feel free to hop into the [developer support forum](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following components installed on your system. The instructions below cover Ubuntu and Mac installations.

<Steps>
  <Tabs items={['Ubuntu', 'Mac']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ### Ubuntu Installation

      These instructions were verified on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Other versions may require slight modifications.

    *   [Install just](https://github.com/casey/just):

    *   Install the command line utilities `make` and `jq`:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y make jq
    ```

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
      ### Mac Installation

    *   [Install Homebrew]( https://brew.sh/) (if not already installed):

    *   Install the required utilities:

    ```sh
    brew install make jq just
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Installing Go

Install Go on your system by following the official [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install). Be sure to install the latest stable version.

After installation, you can verify Go is correctly installed by running:

    ```sh
    go version
    ```

  ### Clone the Optimism monorepo

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
  cd optimism
  ```

  ### Install Foundry using monorepo tooling

  The following command will install Foundry if it is not already installed on your system. If an error occurs during execution, please run `source /root/.bashrc` and try again.

  ```sh
  just install-foundry
  ```

  If you do already have Foundry installed, make sure to run the following to verify your installed version will work with the monorepo tooling as expected.

  ```sh
  just check-foundry
  ```

  If you need to, you can run the following to update Foundry to the expected version.

  ```sh
  just update-foundry
  ```
</Steps>

## Operations

*   To start, run (in the root directory of the monorepo) `make devnet-up`.\
    The first time it runs it will be relatively slow because it needs to download the images, after that it will be faster.

*   To stop, run (in the root directory of the monorepo) `make devnet-down`.

*   To clean everything, run (in the root directory of the monorepo) `make devnet-clean`.

## Additional Info

*   [The monorepo includes L1 contract addresses](/chain/addresses) and [the devnet L1 deploy configs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/devnetL1.json).
    The L2 contract addresses are, of course, the standard ones.

*   There are some differences between the development node and the real world (a.k.a. Ethereum mainnet and OP Mainnet):

    | Parameter                           | Real-world | Devnode |
    | ----------------------------------- | ---------: | ------: |
    | L1 chain ID                         |          1 |     900 |
    | L2 chain ID                         |         10 |     901 |
    | Time between L1 blocks (in seconds) |         12 |       6 |

*   Pre-Funded Dev Accounts

    By default, the same 10 dev accounts that are pre-funded using Anvil or HardHat are also pre-funded on both L1 and L2:

    <Callout>
      These private keys are common knowledge, you should **not** use them on any network other than this dev network.
      Using these private keys on mainnet, or even a testnet, will most likely result **in a loss of funds**.
