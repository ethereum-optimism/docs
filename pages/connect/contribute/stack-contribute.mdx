# Contribute to the OP Stack

The OP Stack is a collaborative, decentralized development stack that only gets more powerful as more people contribute. Code for the OP Stack should follow the stack's [design principles](/stack/design-principles), which means it should be entirely open source and accessible for people to hack on, contribute to, and extend.
The Optimism Collective wins when it works together. ♥️✨

Whether you're a budding chain operator, app developer, node operator, bounty hunter, content creator, or anything in between, the OP Stack always has something for you to contribute to.
Every contribution makes a difference — no contribution is too small. If you're ready to contribute, check out one of the following contributor pathways below.

## Component Contributions

The OP Stack is a decentralized development stack and is constantly evolving as new layers and modules are developed. Anyone can contribute components that can be considered part of the OP Stack as long as those components fit the stack's [design principles and goals](/stack/design-principles).
To start contributing components to the stack, check out some of these [useful ideas](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions) and get to building! And don't forget that projects can also receive grants from the Collective via [RetroPGF](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/#how-retropgf-works).

## Codebase Contributions

The OP Stack codebase is not a product (in the traditional sense) but rather a collection of software components that power the Optimism ecosystem.
If you'd like to contribute to the current release of OP Stack codebase, rather than creating new components, your contribution would be greatly appreciated.
**A "Release"of the OP Stack codebase is a particular set of software components that are production-ready and which fit the stack's design principles and goals.**

To make your first contribution to the codebase, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues) on the Optimism Monorepo.

<Callout type="warning">
  Only the software components included within the current release of the OP Stack codebase are considered in the scope of the OP Stack.
  Any usage of the OP Stack outside of the official, intended capabilities of the current release are considered [OP Stack Hacks](/builders/chain-operators/hacks/overview) — unofficial modifications that are useful for experimentation but could have unforeseen results, such as security vulnerabilities, and are likely to cause your chain to no longer be interoperable with the [Optimism Superchain](https://app.optimism.io/superchain/).
  Developer support for OP Stack Hacks is limited — when in doubt, stick to the capabilities of the current release!

## Bounty Hunting

The OP Stack needs YOU (yes you!) to help review the codebase for bugs and vulnerabilities. If you're interested in bounty hunting, check out our [Security Policy, Vulnerability Reporting, and Bug Bounties page](/chain/security/security-policy).
