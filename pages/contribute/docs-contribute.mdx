# Contribute to Optimism Docs

Optimism Developer Docs (docs.optimism.io) is an open-source project, and we welcome your contributions. Here's how you can help grow and support the Optimism Collective.

<Callout type="info">
  We recently migrated our technical docs from community.optimism.io --> docs.optimism.io.
  So, if you contributed to either repo in 2023, don't forget to claim your [POAP token](#claim-your-gitpoap)!

## How to work on docs.optimism.io

Whether you're adding to the site, creating content, or working on open issues, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
All updates are made via the GitHub PR process. This means you create a local copy of the website, make your changes and request to merge your changes.
Please see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

You don't need permission to work on anything, but it's always best to let us know what you're planning to do, so we don't duplicate efforts. You can do this by:

-   Commenting on an issue or PR in [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/)
-   Messaging us in the [developer support channel](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/)

Before contributing, make sure you're familiar with:

-   the [Optimism vision and values](https://www.optimism.io/about)
-   our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
-   our [style guide](style-guide)
-   our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How decisions about the site are made

Decisions about individual PRs, tutorials, and major docs updates are made by the Optimism Docs team housed in Developer Relations.
We want to transition to a more community-informed and community-generated approach for the Optimism Developer Docs, so please raise questions in issues, submit PRs, or contact the team:

-   [devrel@oplabs.co](mailto:devrel@oplabs.co)

### A note on plagiarism

Only use your original work or content that you have permission to use when contributing any content or artifact to docs.optimism.io.
Many projects use open-source licensing that allows for the free sharing of information. However, if you cannot find this information, do not attempt to add it to docs.optimism.io.
Any pull requests deemed as plagiarism will get rejected.

## Claim your GitPOAP

We use GitPOAPs to recognize our contributors! GitPOAP automatically recognizes your merged contribution and lets you mint a unique contributors POAP directly on their platform.

### How to claim

1.  Visit [Optimism's GitPOAP page](https://www.gitpoap.io/gh/ethereum-optimism).
2.  Connect with your wallet or your email through sign in option.
3.  Search for your GitHub username, ETH address, ENS names or any GitPOAP to check if you're eligible.
4.  If your GitHub account is eligible, then you are able to mint a GitPOAP!

<Callout type="warning">
  You should only use self-custody wallets to claim POAPs. Do not use exchange accounts or other accounts you do not hold the private keys to, as these will not allow you to access and manage your POAPs.
</Callout>
