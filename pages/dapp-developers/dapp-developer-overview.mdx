# Dapp Developer Overview

This document provides an overview of tools and resources to help you build applications for Optimism. It points you to guides on basic contract deployment and cross-chain messaging and tutorials specific to app developers.
If you're looking for third-party tools that make building apps on OP Mainnet easier, check out the [Developer Tools](/tools/overview) section.

## Getting Started

If you're brand new to OP Mainnet, we recommend starting with the guide on [deploying a basic contract](/getting-started-op-mainnet).
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Luckily, OP Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), so it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum.

You might also want to check out the [testing on OP Networks guide](testing) and the tutorial on [running a local development environment](/testing/dev-node) to help you feel totally confident in your OP Mainnet deployment.

## Cross-Chain Messaging

Looking to explore cross-chain messaging? We've got detailed guides for that.
If you want to bridge a token from Ethereum to OP Mainnet (or vice versa!), you should check out our [Standard Token Bridge](bridging/standard-bridge).
The Standard Token Bridge makes the process of moving tokens between chains as easy as possible.

If you're looking for something more advanced, we recommend reading through our guide on [sending data between L1 and L2](bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, it's pretty cool!
We even dogfood the same infrastructure and use it under the hood of the Standard Token Bridge.

## Specific Tutorials

If you're a bit more familiar with OP Mainnet and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the tutorials put together by the Optimism community.
They'll help you get a headstart when building your first Optimistic project. 

| Tutorial Name | Description | Difficulty Level | 
| ------------- | ----------- | -----------------|
| [Writing Your First Contract on Optimism](tutorials/first-contract) | Learn how to write your first contact on Optimism using MetaMask browser extension as a wallet. | 🟢 Easy |
| [Using OP Mainnet System Contracts](tutorials/system-contracts) | Learn how to work with OP Mainnet contracts directly from other contracts *and* how to work with contracts from the client side. | 🟢 Easy |
| [Bridging ETH with the Optimism SDK](tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-eth) | Learn how to use the Optimism SDK to transfer ETH between Layer 1 (Ethereum or Goerli) and Layer 2 (OP Mainnet or OP Goerli). | 🟢 Easy |
| [Bridging ERC-20 tokens with the Optimism SDK](tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20) | Learn how to use the Optimism SDK to transfer ERC-20 tokens between Layer 1 (Ethereum or Goerli) and Layer 2 (OP Mainnet or OP Goerli). | 🟢 Easy |
| [Bridging your Standard ERC-20 token to OP Mainnet using the Standard Bridge](tutorials/standard-bridge-standard-token) | Learn how to bridge your standard ERC-20 token to OP Mainnet using the standard bridge. | 🟡 Moderate |
| [Bridging your Custom ERC-20 token to OP Mainnet using the Standard Bridge](tutorials/standard-bridge-custom-token) | Learn how to bridge your custom ERC-20 token to OP Mainnet using the standard bridge. | 🟡 Moderate |

You can also [suggest a new tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=tutorial%2Cdocumentation%2Ccommunity-request&projects=&template=suggest_tutorial.yaml&title=%5BTUTORIAL%5D+Add+PR+title) if you have something specific in mind. We'd love to grow our tutorials list for Dapp developers!
