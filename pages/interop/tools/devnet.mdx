# Superchain interop devnet

<Callout>
   NOTE: The current Interop devnet has been deprecated. This page will be updated once the next Interop devnet is live.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Superchain interop devnet is currently in active development and may experience periods of instability, including potential outages, as the networks are regularly updated and improved. Developers should expect some level of unreliability when interacting with the devnet. The devnet is intended for testing and development purposes only, and should not be relied upon for mission-critical applications.
</Callout>

The Superchain interop devnet is a temporary public network of two OP Stack Sepolia instances that support Superchain interop enabling native ETH and SuperchainERC20 cross-chain token transfers. As we iterate on Superchain interop, these networks will be deprecated once the next devnets are released.

1.  The "currency symbol" is required by some wallets like MetaMask.
2.  The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1 and L2. You can send `ETH` directly to the portal to receive it to the sender address on the L2.

## Getting testnet ETH on the interop devnet

<Steps>
  ### Get testnet ETH from the Superchain Faucet

  You can utilize the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=op-docs&utm_medium=docs) to get `ETH`.
</Steps>

## Bridging ETH to the interop devnet

<Steps>
  ### Get Sepolia ETH from the Superchain Faucet

  You can utilize the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=op-docs&utm_medium=docs) to get `ETH` on Sepolia.

  ### Send the Sepolia ETH to the devnet

  You can send `ETH` directly to the `OptimismPortal` address and it will go to the same sender address on the devnet. Alternatively, you can use this [bridge front end](https://interop-devnet.superbridge.app/) to bridge `ETH` from Sepolia.

  ### Wait for bridging to complete

  It'll take approximately 2 minutes for the bridging process from Sepolia to L2 to complete and the `ETH` to appear in your wallet.
</Steps>

## Next steps

*   Build a [revolutionary app](/app-developers/get-started) that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
*   Deploy a [SuperchainERC20](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20) to the Superchain
*   View more [interop tutorials](/interop/tutorials)
