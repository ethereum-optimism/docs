## Overview

Learn to relay transactions directly by sending the correct transaction.

<details>
  <summary>About this tutorial</summary>

  **Prerequisite technical knowledge**

  *   Familiarity with blockchain concepts
  *   Familiarity with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), especially `cast`

  **What you'll learn**

  *   How to use `cast` to relay transactions when autorelay does not work
  *   How to relay transactions using JavaScript

  **Development environment requirements**

  *   Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
  *   Node.js version 16 or higher
  *   Git for version control
  *   Supersim environment configured and running
  *   Foundry tools installed (forge, cast, anvil)
</details>

### What you'll build

*   A program to relay messages using [the JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/viem)
*   A shell script to relay messages using [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/)

## Setup

These steps are necessary to run the tutorial, regardless of whether you are using `cast` or the JavaScript API.

<Steps>
  ### Run Supersim

  This exercise needs to be done on Supersim.
  You cannot use the devnets because you cannot disable autorelay on them.

  1.  Follow the [installation guide](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim/getting-started/installation).

  2.  Run Supersim *without* `--interop.relay`.

      ```sh
      ./supersim
      ```

  ### Create the state for relaying messages

  The results of this step are similar to what the [message passing tutorial](/interop/tutorials/message-passing) would produce if you did not have autorelay on.

  Execute this script.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-manual-relay.sh hash=eea0a71ff6b4c27b91225a715eb2718e 
  ```

  This script installs `Greeter.sol` on chain B and `GreetingSender.sol` on chain A.
  These smart contracts let us send a message from chain A that needs to be relayed to chain B.

  Then, the script creates `./manual-relay/sendAndRelay.sh` to manually relay a message from chain A to chain B.
  That script is [explained below](#manual-relay-using-cast).

  Finally, this script writes out some parameter setting lines that should be executed on the main shell before you continue.
  With a fresh Supersim running, these should be:

  ```sh
  GREETER_A_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
  GREETER_B_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
  PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
  ```

</Steps>

## Manual relay using the API

<Steps>
  ### Setup

  Use a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) project.

  1.  Initialize a new Node project.

      ```sh
      mkdir -p manual-relay/offchain
      cd manual-relay/offchain
      npm init -y
      npm install --save-dev viem @eth-optimism/viem
      mkdir src
      ```

  2.  Export environment variables.
      This is necessary because those variables are currently limited to the shell process.
      We need them in the Node process that the shell creates.

      ```sh
      export GREETER_A_ADDRESS GREETER_B_ADDRESS PRIVATE_KEY
      ```

  ### Manual relaying app

  1.  Create a file `manual-relay.mjs` with:

      ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs hash=b0c44b327af300437f3d71ff049842f9
      ```

      <details>
        <summary>Explanation</summary>

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L8-L9 hash=2d062eb374989a8a40199a4d7dc8be6e
        ```

        Import from the [`@eth-optimism/viem`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/viem) package.

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L18-L32 hash=cf5ce47bcbcd80327230a6da689688f8
        ```

        In addition to extending the wallets with [Viem public actions](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local#5-optional-extend-with-public-actions), extend with the OP-Stack actions.
        On wallet A we need the public actions, those that only read information.
        On wallet B we need the wallet actions, the ones that require an account.

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L55 hash=23aa6f24baeb5757130361f30c1b0e9c
        ```

        To relay a message we need the information in the receipt.
        Also, we need to wait until the transaction with the relayed message is actually part of a block.

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L57-L58 hash=c0d3d8a60143c30b93db256518e8b583
        ```        

        Show the user that until the relay transaction happens on chain B, the greeting is unchanged.

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L60-L63 hash=8cc99e67ee36474c81183108531cb295
        ```

        A single transaction can send multiple messages.
        But here we know we sent just one, so we look for the first one in the list.

        ```javascript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/manual-relay.mjs#L64-L71 hash=b7ed7d70ba5ec84322beee5369c5bee5
        ```

        Here we first send the relay message on chain B, and then wait for the receipt for it.
      </details>

  2.  Run JavaScript program, and see that the message is relayed.

      ```sh
      node manual-relay.mjs
      ```

  ### Debugging

  To see what messages were relayed by a specific transaction you can use this code:

  ```javascript
  import { decodeRelayedL2ToL2Messages } from '@eth-optimism/viem'

  const decodedRelays = decodeRelayedL2ToL2Messages(
      {receipt: receiptRelay})

  console.log(decodedRelays)
  console.log(decodedRelays.successfulMessages[0].log)
  ```
</Steps>

## Manual relay using `cast`

You can see an example of how to manually relay using `cast` in `manual-relay/sendAndRelay.sh`. 
It is somewhat complicated, so the setup creates one that is tailored to your environment.

You can run the script using this command:

```sh
./manual-relay/sendAndRelay.sh
```

Here is the detailed explanation:

1.  Configuration parameters

    ```sh
    #! /bin/sh
    PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
    USER_ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
    URL_CHAIN_A=http://localhost:9545
    URL_CHAIN_B=http://localhost:9546
    GREETER_A_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
    GREETER_B_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
    CHAIN_ID_B=902
    ```

    This is the configuration.
    The greeter addresses are identical because the nonce for the user address has an identical nonce on both chains.

2.  Send a message that needs to be relayed

    ```sh
    cast send -q --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A $GREETER_A_ADDRESS "setGreeting(string)" "Hello from chain A $$"
    ```

    Send a message from chain A to chain B. The `$$` is the process ID, so if you rerun the script you'll see that the information changes.

3.  Find the log entry to relay

    ```sh
    cast logs "SentMessage(uint256,address,uint256,address,bytes)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A | tail -14 > log-entry
    ```

    Whenever `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` sends a message to a different blockchain, it emits a [`SendMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L83-L91) event.
    Extract only the latest `SendMessage` event from the logs.

    <details>
      <summary>Example `log-entry`</summary>

      ```yaml
      - address: 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023
        blockHash: 0xcd0be97ffb41694faf3a172ac612a23f224afc1bfecd7cb737a7a464cf5d133e
        blockNumber: 426
        data: 0x0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064a41368620000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001948656c6c6f2066726f6d20636861696e2041203131333030370000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

        transactionIndex: 0
      ```
    </details>

4.  Manipulate the log entry to obtain information

    ```sh
    TOPICS=`cat log-entry | grep -A4 topics | awk '{print $1}' | tail -4 | sed 's/0x//'`
    TOPICS=`echo $TOPICS | sed 's/ //g'`
    ```

    Consolidate the log topics into a single hex string.

    ```sh
    ORIGIN=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023
    BLOCK_NUMBER=`cat log-entry | awk '/blockNumber/ {print $2}'`
    LOG_INDEX=`cat log-entry | awk '/logIndex/ {print $2}'`
    TIMESTAMP=`cast block $BLOCK_NUMBER --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A | awk '/timestamp/ {print $2}'`
    CHAIN_ID_A=`cast chain-id --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_A`
    SENT_MESSAGE=`cat log-entry | awk '/data/ {print $2}'`
    ```

    Read additional fields from the log entry.

    ```sh
    LOG_ENTRY=0x`echo $TOPICS$SENT_MESSAGE | sed 's/0x//'`
    ```

    Consolidate the entire log entry.

5.  Create the access list for the executing message

    ```sh
    RPC_PARAMS=$(cat <<INNER_END_OF_FILE
    {
        "origin": "$ORIGIN",
        "blockNumber": "$BLOCK_NUMBER",
        "logIndex": "$LOG_INDEX",
        "timestamp": "$TIMESTAMP",
        "chainId": "$CHAIN_ID_A",
        "payload": "$LOG_ENTRY"
    }
    INNER_END_OF_FILE
    )

    ACCESS_LIST=`cast rpc admin_getAccessListForIdentifier --rpc-url http://localhost:8420 "$RPC_PARAMS" | jq .accessList`
    ```

    To secure cross-chain messaging and prevent potential [denial-of-service attacks](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/main/protocol/interop-access-list.md), relay transactions require properly formatted access lists that include a checksum derived from the message data.
    This lets sequencers know what executing messages to expect in a transaction, which makes it easy not to include transactions that are invalid because they rely on messages that were never sent.

    The [algorithm to calculate the access list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L87-L115) is a bit complicated, but you don't need to worry about it.
    Supersim exposes [RPC calls](https://supersim.pages.dev/guides/interop/cast?highlight=manuall#7-construct-the-access-list-for-the-message) that calculates it for you on port 8420.
    The code above will calculate the correct access list even if you're using a different interop cluster where autorelay is not functioning. 
    This is because the code implements a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which produces consistent results regardless of external state.
    In contrast, the `admin_getAccessListByMsgHash` RPC call is not a pure function, it is dependent on system state and therefore less flexible in these situations.

6.  Show that the manual relay is necessary

    ```sh
    echo Old greeting
    cast call $GREETER_B_ADDRESS "greet()(string)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B
    ```

    Show the current greeting.
    The message has not been relayed yet, so it's still the old greeting.

7.  Actually relay the message

    ```sh
    cast send -q $ORIGIN "relayMessage((address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256),bytes)" "($ORIGIN,$BLOCK_NUMBER,$LOG_INDEX,$TIMESTAMP,$CHAIN_ID_A)" $LOG_ENTRY --access-list "$ACCESS_LIST" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

    Call [`relayMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L197-L256) to relay the message.

8.  Show the relay results

    ```sh
    echo New greeting
    cast call $GREETER_B_ADDRESS "greet()(string)" --rpc-url $URL_CHAIN_B
    ```

    Again, show the current greeting.
    Now it's the new one.


## Next steps
