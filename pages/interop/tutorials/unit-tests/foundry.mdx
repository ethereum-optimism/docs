# Interop and unit tests using Foundry

Most of parts of the contracts can be [tested normally](/app-developers/testing-apps).
This tutorials teaches you how to verify that a message has been sent successfully, and how to fake receiving a message, the two functions that tie directly into interop.
To show how this works, we test [the `Greeter` and `GreetingSender` contracts](/interop/tutorials/message-passing).

## Setup

The results of this step are similar to what the [message passing tutorial](/interop/tutorials/message-passing) would produce,

This script creates a Foundry project (in `testing/forge`) and a Hardhat project (in `testing/hardhat`) with the necessary files.
Execute it in a UNIX or Linux environment.

```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh hash=a77f9926b61271c1895ad2c9527f9fd1 
```

## Test sending a message

The easiest way to test sending a message is to see [the event emitted by `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L160).

To see this in action, run these commands:

```
cd testing/forge
forge test GreetingSender --fork-url https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io
```

The default [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) instance created by `forge test` does not contain the interop contracts, so we need to fork [a blockchain that does](/interop/tools/devnet).

The test is implemented by `tests/GreetingSender.t.sol`.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L109-L117 hash=e8c77299b01dd6f03d3e36d2e9d82608 
  ```

  The definition for the event we expect to see, [from the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L160).

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L119-L121 hash=645c522fafccb282df37b7d3df27bd3f 
  ```

  Create a new `GreetingSender` instance for each test.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L124-L129 hash=5e79ce67c4e5f54eee5b8d09ace39860 
  ```

  Calculate the message to be sent, the same way that `GreetingSender` does.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L132-L132 hash=028411291cccc262557abde834549fc2 
  ```

  Out of the indexed topics, verify the first (destination chain) and second (address on the destination chain).
  Ignore the third topic, the nonce, because it can vary.
  Finally, verify that the unindexed data of the log entry (the sender address and the message) is correct.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L133-L133 hash=37203df9264e95e763befaf2e5dbbfab 
  ```

  Emit the message we expect to see.

  ```sh file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/setup-for-testing.sh#L135-L135 hash=9322933b2f965ddc75bb8d3b2ab4c95d 
  ```

  Call the code being tested, which should emit a similar log entry to the one we just emitted.
