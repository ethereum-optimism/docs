# Interop and unit tests using Hardhat

Most of parts of the contracts can be [tested normally](/app-developers/testing-apps).
This tutorials teaches you how to verify that a message has been sent successfully, and how to fake receiving a message, the two functions that tie directly into interop.
To show how this works, we test [the `Greeter` and `GreetingSender` contracts](/interop/tutorials/message-passing).

## Setup

This script creates a Foundry project (in `testing/forge`) and a Hardhat project (in `testing/hardhat`) with the necessary files.
Execute it in a UNIX or Linux environment.

The results of this step are similar to what the [message passing tutorial](/interop/tutorials/message-passing) produces.
