# Upgrading ERC20 to SuperchainERC20

## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade an ERC20 to a [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) that can teleport across the [Superchain interop cluster](/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster) using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract. For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/interop/superchain-erc20).

{/* 

I put this warning here when we don't have it on most pages because this tutorial
has, IMHO, code that is a lot more likely to be used in production. It doesn't just
show what is possible, it does the exact job needed.

*/}

There are several ways to upgrade an existing ERC20 for interop, depending on your circumstances:

{/* 

*   If you can upgrade the existing contract, but the address is not available on other chains? In that case, use a custom bridge
