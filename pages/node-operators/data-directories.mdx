# Download Data Directories

This guide provides download links to data directories that are necessary for starting your own node.

<Callout>
  Links to download data directories will be posted here as soon as they are available.

## OP Mainnet

-   [Bedrock Data Directory (303 GB)<sup>1</sup>](https://datadirs.optimism.io/mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst).
    The `sha512sum` for this file is `c17067b7bc39a6daa14f71d448c6fa0477834c3e68a25e96f26fe849c12a09bffe510e96f7eacdef19e93e3167d15250f807d252dd6f6f9053d0e4457c73d5fb`.
-   [Legacy Geth Data Directory (2.9TB)<sup>1</sup>](https://datadirs.optimism.io/mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst).
    The `sha512sum` for this file is `e348488c458baa755510f23bbc8601619bc66bea78a89354c949ba7be3c6b39ed7dd2c50516621e38df6120299407da0d24445b96bf94a50364ed07bb8234b26`.
    Note that you *only* need this file if you run `l2geth` to answer archive queries prior to the bedrock upgrade.
    If you are running an archive only for post-bedrock transactions (using `op-geth` with the command line flag `gcmode=archive`), you do *not* need this file.
-   [Configuration parameters](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/mainnet.json).
-   [Latest release of `op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/latest)
-   [Latest release of `op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/) - you need to scroll down until you get a release that has `op-node` in it.
-   [Legacy geth](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ethereumoptimism/l2geth/0.5.31/images/sha256-5577036dc36d167d11f5ac49b91cc0a3d835574928a9563783c2e70309e5eb28?context=explore).

(1) This file is compressed with `zstd`.
We recommend that users install the command line tool if it is not already installed on their system.
`tar -xf` will work without installing anything if you have an up to date version of `tar`.
If you want to decompress separately, we recommend `pzstd -d`  or `zstd -d` (pzstd will likely be faster).

## OP Goerli

-   [Bedrock Data Directory (5.0GB)<sup>1</sup>](https://datadirs.optimism.io/goerli-bedrock.tar.zst).
    The `sha512sum` for this file is `7d420ddf34ee5b157d60cf7a9612cb950b24ff1405e1ab944f8d7910c45e7a46907bdb86ea124a8069b15ad9e171776ab5f8ed0146c43b0ff12539f38f262f7d`.
-   [Legacy Geth Data Directory (50GB)<sup>1</sup>](https://datadirs.optimism.io/goerli-legacy-archival.tar.zst).
    The `sha512sum` for this file is `5d78c1f2cd5bea062fb979b9d616a5fe4c55b27a444812b91a90340631d7a5f750c4e6e5a352513f3cf102d61586a4e2861f1aa3827e5be8fcae01e2ec291d2a`.

-   [Configuration parameters](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/goerli.json)
-   [Latest releases of `op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/latest)
-   [Latest release of `op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/) - you need to scroll down until you get a release that has `op-node` in it.
-   [Legacy geth](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ethereumoptimism/l2geth/0.5.31/images/sha256-5577036dc36d167d11f5ac49b91cc0a3d835574928a9563783c2e70309e5eb28?context=explore)

## OP Sepolia

-   Note that there is no Bedrock Data Directory or Legacy Geth Data Directory required for running OP Sepolia nodes
-   [Configuration parameters](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/sepolia.json)
-   [Genesis.json File](https://networks.optimism.io/op-sepolia/genesis.json)
-   [Latest releases of `op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/latest)
-   [Latest release of `op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/latest)
-   Note: Unlike on OP Mainnet or OP Goerli, you do not need to run `legacy-geth` to run an archival OP Sepolia node.
