# Troubleshooting: Run a Node

This page lists common troubleshooting scenarios and solutions for node operators.

## 401 Unauthorized: Signature Invalid

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
WARN [12-13|15:53:20.263] Derivation process temporary error       attempts=80 err="stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: failed to fetch current L2 forkchoice state: failed to find the finalized L2 block: failed to determine L2BlockRef of finalized, could not get payload: 401 Unauthorized: signature is invalid
```

It means that the `op-node` is unable to authenticate with `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC using the JWT secret. To fix:

1.  Check that the JWT secret is correct in both services.
2.  Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

## 403 Forbidden: Invalid Host Specified

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"err":"403 Forbidden: invalid host specified\n","lvl":"error","msg":"error getting latest header","t":"2022-12-13T22:29:18.932833159Z"}
```

It means that you have not whitelisted `op-node`'s host with `op-geth`. To fix:

1.  Make sure that the `--authrpc.vhosts` parameter in `op-geth` is either set to the correct host, or `*`.
2.  Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

## Failed to Load P2P Config

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
CRIT [12-13|13:46:21.386] Application failed                       message="failed to load p2p config: failed to load p2p discovery options: failed to open discovery db: mkdir /p2p: permission denied"
```

It means that the `op-node` does not have write access to the P2P discovery or peerstore directories. To fix:

1.  Make sure that the `op-node` has write access to the P2P directory. By default, this is `/p2p`.
2.  Set the P2P directory to somewhere the `op-node` can access via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.
3.  Set the discovery path to `memory` to disable persistence via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.

## Wrong Chain

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"attempts":183,"err":"stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: wrong chain L1: genesis: 0x4104895a540d87127ff11eef0d51d8f63ce00a6fc211db751a45a4b3a61a9c83:8106656, got 0x12e2c18a3ac50f74d3dd3c0ed7cb751cc924c2985de3dfed44080e683954f1dd:8106656","lvl":"warn","msg":"Derivation process temporary error","t":"2022-12-13T23:31:37.855253213Z"}
```

It means that the `op-node` is pointing to the wrong chain. To fix:

1.  Verify that the `op-node`'s L1 URL is pointing to the correct L1 for the given network.
2.  Verify that the `op-node`'s rollup config/`--network` parameter is set to the correct network.
3.  Verify that the `op-node`'s L2 URL is pointing to the correct instance of `op-geth`, and that `op-geth` is properly initialized for the given network.
