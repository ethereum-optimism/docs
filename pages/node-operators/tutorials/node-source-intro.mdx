# Building a Node from Source

Here are the instructions if you want to build your own node without relying on images from Optimism. These instructions were generated on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS box, but they should work with other systems too.

## Before You Begin

### Hardware requirements

Nodes need to process and store the transaction history of OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia. They need to be relatively powerful machines (real or virtual). We recommend at least 16 GB RAM. We recommend a 2TB SSD for OP Mainnet, our current archive node usage is ~1TB. We recommend a 256GB SSD for OP Sepolia, or current full node usage is ~1.6GB and archive node usage is ~5.6GB.

### Software requirements

Youâ€™ll need the following software installed to follow this tutorial:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

-   [Go](https://go.dev/)

-   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

-   [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

-   [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation)

-   [Make](https://linux.die.net/man/1/make)

-   [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

-   [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

-   [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)

## Building the software

### Build the Optimism Monorepo

1.  Navigate to your working directory.

2.  Clone the [Optimism Monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
    ```

3.  Install required modules.

    ```bash
    cd optimism
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  Build the various packages inside of the Optimism Monorepo.

    ```bash
    make op-node
    pnpm build
    ```

This process will take some time, so you can move onto the next section while the build completes.

### Build op-geth

1.  Navigate to your working directory.

2.  Clone [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth.git
    ```

3.  Build `op-geth`:

    ```bash
    cd op-geth    
    make geth
    ```

### (Optional - OP Mainnet Archive Node) Build l2geth

<Callout type="info">
  OP Mainnet Archive Node
  This step is only necessary for OP Mainnet archive nodes. If you're building a OP Testnet archive node, you do not need to do this step.
</Callout>

1.  Navigate to your working directory

2.  Clone [`l2geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-legacy)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-legacy.git
    ```

3.  Build `l2geth`:

    ```bash
    cd optimism-legacy/l2geth
    make
    ```

<br />

## Next Steps

The rest of the steps depend on whether you want to run an OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia node.
