# Superchain withdrawal pause test

<Callout type="info">
  *   Sepolia Superchain withdrawal pause test is scheduled for **April 14th 2025**
  *   Mainnet Superchain withdrawal pause test is scheduled for **April 30th 2025**
</Callout>

The Optimism Collective will be testing improved incident response features on the Sepolia Superchain. 

During this excercise, the privileged [`GUARDIAN`](/superchain/privileged-roles#guardian) address will call the `pause` function on the `SuperchainConfig`. 
Members of the Optimism Collective's security team will ensure that the pause is executed correctly and the incident response improvements worked as intended. 
Then the `unpause` function will be called to resume normal operations. 
To learn more about this functionality, please refer to this [documentation](/stack/security/pause). 

This functionality is important for the security of the Superchain and should be understood by Chain Operators, users, and especially for centralized exchanges and third-party bridge operators. **Please note that this will not effect any L1-to-L2 deposit transactions or L2 transactions. No action is required from users or operators.**
