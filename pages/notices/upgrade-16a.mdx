# Upgrade 16a: Protocol upgrade

Upgrade 16a is a **maintenance release that supersedes Upgrade 16**. It temporarily removes unused interop withdrawal-proving code introduced in Upgrade 16 and adds system-level feature toggles to improve flexibility and rollout safety. These changes reduce risk while maintaining momentum toward the Superchain roadmap.

<Callout type="info">
  The Upgrade 16a protocol upgrade on the **Sepolia** Superchain will be executed on **Mon, Sept 22, 2025**, and the **Mainnet** Superchain will be activated on **Thu, Oct 2, 2025.
  The upgrade will be executed on the following chains: `OP`, `Base`, `Soneium`, `Ink`, and `Unichain`.
  Execution times may vary depending on the current state of each chain.
</Callout>

## What's included in Upgrade 16a

Upgrade 16a introduces the following changes:

**Removal of interop withdrawal-proving code**: Code paths for interop withdrawals added in Upgrade 16 have been removed following partner feedback. ETHLockbox remains supported on chains already running U16. Chains moving directly from U15 → U16a will not adopt ETHLockbox until a future upgrade.

**System-level feature toggles**
    Added via the `SystemConfig` contract. ETHLockbox is the first feature placed behind a toggle. This mechanism enables chain-specific configuration and safer iterative upgrades.

**Development-only feature flags**
    Introduced to allow testing of interop functionality on non-production environments. These flags cannot be enabled on production chains.

**OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) updates**
    Updated to support both upgrade paths: `U15 → U16a` and `U16 → U16a`.

## Impact summary

*   No downtime is expected.
*   Withdrawal proofs created under U16 remain valid.
*   Chains still on U15 are affected in the same way described in the Upgrade 16 notice.
*   Chains upgrading directly from U15 → U16a will not adopt ETHLockbox until a future release.
*   System-level toggles improve operator control and make future upgrades easier to roll out.

## For chain operators

<Callout>Withdrawal invalidation impacts only chains still on U15 (or lower).
Any pending L1 withdrawals on those chains that are not finalized before the upgrade executes will need to be reproven after the upgrade completes. Users must re-submit their proof transactions after the upgrade.
Chains already on U16 are not affected. No funds are at risk.

If you're upgrading from Upgrade 15, follow the [chain operator instructions for U16](https://docs.optimism.io/notices/upgrade-16#for-chain-operators).
