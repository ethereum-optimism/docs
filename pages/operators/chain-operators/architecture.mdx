# Chain architecture

This page contains information about the components of the rollup protocol and
how they work together to build the layer 2 blockchain from the Chain Operator's
perspective. The OP Stack is built in such a way that it is as similar to
Ethereum as possible. Like Ethereum, the OP Stack has execution and consensus
clients. The OP Stack also has some privileged roles that produce L2 blocks.
If you want a more detailed view of the OP Stack protocol, check out the
[OP Stack section](/stack/getting-started) of our documentation.

## Permissioned components

These clients and services work together to enable the block production on the L2 network.
Sequencer nodes (`op-geth` + `op-node`) gather proposed transactions from users.
The batcher submits batch data to L1 which controls the safe blocks and ultimately
controls the canonical chain. The proposer submits output roots to L1 which control
L2 to L1 messaging.

### op-geth

`op-geth` implements the layer 2 execution layer, with [minimal changes](https://op-geth.optimism.io/)
for a secure Ethereum-equivalent application environment.

### op-node

`op-node` implements most rollup-specific functionality as the layer 2
consensus layer, similar to a layer 1 beacon-node. The `op-node` is stateless and gets
its view of the world from `op-geth`.

### op-batcher

`op-batcher` is the service that submits the L2 Sequencer data to L1, to make it available
for verifiers. To reduce the cost of writing to the L1, it only posts the minimal
amount of data required to reproduce L2 blocks.

### op-deployer

`op-deployer` is a tool that simplifies the process of deploying standardized OP Stack chains that comply with Superchain specifications. 
It compares the state of your chain against the intent, 
and makes whatever changes are necessary for them to match. In its current state, 
it is intended to deploy new standard chains that utilize the Superchain wide contracts.


### op-proposer

<OpProposerDescriptionShort />

## Sequencer

The Sequencer node works with the batcher and proposer to create new blocks. So it should
handle the state changing RPC request `eth_sendRawTransaction`. It can be peered with
replica nodes to gossip new `unsafe` blocks to the rest of the network.

Sequencer op-node should have p2p discovery disabled and only be statically peered with other internal nodes (or use [peer-management-service](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/tree/main/peer-mgmt-service) to define peering network)

A production setup should include:

*   At least one archive sequencer for recovering from deep L1 reorgs
*   Secure P2P configuration with static peering
*   Integration with op-conductor for high availability
*   Disable P2P discovery and define a static peer list for internal nodes.

```yaml
# Recommended sequencer configuration
OP_NODE_P2P_NO_DISCOVERY: "true"
OP_NODE_P2P_PEER_BANNING: "false"
OP_NODE_P2P_STATIC: "<static peer list>"
```

### Sequencer isolation

To maintain network security, the Sequencer node is isolated from the internet and peers exclusively with internal replica nodes. It maintains a shared mempool with replicas for efficient transaction handling.

<Image src="/img/builders/chain-operators/sequencer-node.png" alt="Sequencer Node Diagram" width={400} height={400} />

### Replica node

The replica nodes are additional nodes on the network. They can be peered to the Sequencer,
which might not be connected to the rest of the internet, and other replicas. Additional
replicas can help horizontally scale RPC requests.

<Image src="/img/builders/chain-operators/replica-node.png" alt="Replica Node Diagram" width={200} height={200} />

<Callout type="info">
  To run a rollup, you need a minimum of one archive node. This is required by the proposer as the data that it needs can be older than the data available to a full node.  Note that since the proposer doesn't care what archive node it points to, you can technically point it towards an archive node that isn't the sequencer.
</Callout>

## Ingress traffic

It is important to setup a robust chain architecture to handle large volumes of RPC
requests from your users. The Sequencer node has the important job of working with
the batcher to handle block creation. To allow the Sequencer to focus on that job,
you can peer replica nodes to handle the rest of the work.

An example of this would be to configure [proxyd](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/tree/main/proxyd)
to route RPC methods, retry failed requests, load balance, etc.

Configuration recommendations:

```yaml
GETH_ROLLUP_DISABLETXPOOLGOSSIP: "false"
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNALREMOTES: "false"
GETH_TXPOOL_LIFETIME: "1h"
GETH_TXPOOL_NOLOCALS: "true"
GETH_NETRESTRICT: "10.0.0.0/8" # Restrict P2P to internal IPs
```

## Bootnodes

Bootnodes facilitate peer discovery for network nodes. They help initialize peer connections for both public and private nodes in the network.

### Archive RPC Nodes

We recommend setting up some archive nodes for internal RPC usage, primarily used by the challenger, proposer and security monitoring tools like [monitorism](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring#monitorism).

```yaml
GETH_GCMODE: "archive"
GETH_DB_ENGINE: "pebble"
GETH_STATE_SCHEME: "hash"
```

*   You can also use these nodes taking disk snapshots for disaster recovery.

### Full Snapsync Nodes

*   These nodes provide peers for snap sync, using the snapsync bootnodes for peer discovery.

    ```yaml
    GETH_GCMODE: "full"
    GETH_DB_ENGINE: "pebble"
    GETH_STATE_SCHEME: "path"
    GETH_SYNCMODE: "snap"
    ```

### Snapsync Bootnodes

*   These bootnodes facilitate peer discovery for public nodes using snapsync.
*   The bootnode can be either a geth instance or the [geth bootnode tool](https://etclabscore.github.io/core-geth/core/alltools/).
    *   If you want to use geth for snapsync bootnodes, you may want to just make the Full Snapsync Nodes serve as your bootnodes as well.

### P2P Bootnodes

*   These are the op-node p2p network bootnodes. We recommend using the [geth bootnode tool](https://etclabscore.github.io/core-geth/core/alltools/) with discovery v5 enabled.

## Offchain components

In addition to the core protocol components, the following offchain services are essential for running a production-grade rollup network.

### op-conductor

The [op-conductor](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-conductor) RPC can act as a leader-aware rpc proxy for op-batcher (proxies the necessary op-geth / op-node RPC methods if the node is the leader).

### op-challenger

The [op-challenger](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-challenger) verifies the correctness of the L2 state by challenging invalid state transitions. This ensures the network's security and validity.

### Ethereum L1 nodes

These nodes are required to interface with the Ethereum mainnet, handling data submission and validation.

## Peering guidelines

### Consensus layer peering

Ensure proper peer configurations for consensus layer clients. Use static peer lists for critical components and restrict P2P traffic to internal IP ranges.

### Execution layer peering

Execution layer clients, like `op-geth`, should be configured for efficient peer-to-peer communication. Utilize the following YAML configuration for static peers and network restrictions:

```yaml
GETH_NETRESTRICT: "10.0.0.0/8" # Restrict P2P to internal IPs
GETH_P2P_NO_DISCOVERY: "true"
GETH_P2P_STATIC: "<static peer list>"
```

### proxyd

This tool is an RPC request router and proxy. It does the following things:

1.  Whitelists RPC methods.
2.  Routes RPC methods to groups of backend services.
3.  Automatically retries failed backend requests.
4.  Track backend consensus (latest, safe, finalized blocks), peer count and sync state.
5.  Re-write requests and responses to enforce consensus.
6.  Load balance requests across backend services.
7.  Cache immutable responses from backends.
8.  Provides metrics to measure request latency, error rates, and the like.

    on your chain.
*   Find out how you can utilize [blob space](/operators/chain-operators/management/blobs)
    to reduce the transaction fee cost on your chain.
