# OP Stack genesis creation

<Callout type="info">
  This guide uses `op-deployer` to generate genesis and rollup configuration files, ensuring standardization and compatibility with the Superchain.
</Callout>

After deploying the L1 system contracts for your OP Stack chain, you need to generate two critical configuration files:

*   **Genesis file** (`genesis.json`): Initializes the execution client (`op-geth`)
*   **Rollup configuration file** (`rollup.json`): Configures the consensus client (`op-node`)

This guide shows you how to generate these files from your L1 contract deployment data using `op-deployer`.

## Prerequisites

Before generating genesis and rollup configuration files, ensure you have:

1.  Installed `op-deployer` following the instructions in the [op-deployer documentation](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation)

2.  Deployed the L1 contracts successfully using the [`op-deployer apply`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#apply-deploy-your-chain) command

3.  Access to your deployment workspace directory (typically `.deployer`)

## Generating genesis and rollup files

After your L1 contracts have been deployed, follow these steps to generate the configuration files:

### Step 1: Locate your deployment state file

The `op-deployer` tool creates a `state.json` file in your workspace directory that contains all the necessary information about your deployed contracts.

Verify that this file exists in your workspace:

```bash
ls -la .deployer/state.json
```

### Step 2: Generate the L2 genesis file

Use the `inspect genesis` command to retrieve your L2 genesis file:

```bash
op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/genesis.json
```

Replace `<L2_CHAIN_ID>` with your L2 network's chain ID.

### Step 3: Generate the rollup configuration file

Use the `inspect rollup` command to retrieve your rollup configuration file:

```bash
op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/rollup.json
```

### Step 4: Verify the generated files

Examine the generated files to ensure they contain the expected configuration:

```bash
# View the genesis file structure
jq . .deployer/genesis.json | head -20

# View the rollup configuration
jq . .deployer/rollup.json
```

The `genesis.json` file contains the initial state of your L2 blockchain, including:

*   Chain configuration parameters
*   Initial account states
*   Genesis block properties

The `rollup.json` file contains the rollup protocol parameters, including:

*   L1 contract addresses
*   Sequencing settings
*   Finality parameters

## Using your configuration files

Once you have generated the configuration files:

1.  **Initialize your execution client** with the genesis file:

    ```bash
    op-geth init --datadir <YOUR_DATA_DIR> .deployer/genesis.json
    ```

2.  **Configure your consensus client** with the rollup file:

    ```bash
    op-node --l2.genesis .deployer/genesis.json --rollup.config .deployer/rollup.json [other options]
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the generated files:

*   [Verify](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#verify-verify-contract-source-code-on-block-explorers) that your L1 contract deployment was successful
*   Check that you're using the correct **L2 chain ID** in the generation commands
*   Ensure your `state.json` file is up-to-date with your latest deployment

<Callout type="warning">
  Never manually edit the generated genesis or rollup files unless you fully understand the implications. Incorrect configurations can lead to consensus failures or chain security issues.
