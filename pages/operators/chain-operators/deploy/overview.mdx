# OP Stack deployment overview

When deploying a **standard OP Stack chain**, you'll be setting up several key
components. It's useful to understand what each of these components does before
you start deploying your chain. The following information assumes you're
deploying a Rollup on Ethereum, but most concepts apply generally to any
standard OP Stack deployment.

## Smart contracts

The OP Stack uses a set of smart contracts on the L1 blockchain to manage
aspects of the Rollup. Each OP Stack chain has its own set of L1 smart
contracts that are deployed when the chain is created.

<Callout type="warning">
  Standard OP Stack chains should only use governance approved and audited
  smart contracts. The monorepo has them tagged with the following pattern
  `op-contracts/vX.X.X` and you can review the release notes for details on the
  changes. Read more about the details in our [Smart Contract Release Section](/stack/smart-contracts#official-releases).
</Callout>

## Sequencer node

OP Stack chains use a Sequencer node to gather proposed transactions from users
and publish them to the L1 blockchain. OP Stack chains rely on at least one of
these Sequencer nodes. You can also run additional replica (non-Sequencer)
nodes.

### Consensus client

OP Stack Rollup nodes, like Ethereum nodes, have a consensus client. The
consensus client is responsible for determining the list and ordering of blocks
and transactions that are part of your blockchain. Several implementations of
the OP Stack consensus client exist, including `op-node` (maintained by the
Optimism Foundation), [`magi`](https://github.com/a16z/magi) (maintained by
a16z) and [`hildr`](https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr) (maintained by OptimismJ).

### Execution client

OP Stack nodes, like Ethereum nodes, also have an execution client. The
execution client is responsible for executing transactions and maintaining the
state of the blockchain. Various implementations of the OP Stack execution
client exist, including `op-geth` (maintained by the Optimism Foundation),
[`op-erigon`](https://github.com/testinprod-io/op-erigon) (maintained by Test
in Prod), and [`op-nethermind`](https://docs.nethermind.io/get-started/installing-nethermind/#supported-networks).

## Batcher

The Batcher is a service that publishes transactions from the Rollup to the L1
blockchain. The Batcher runs continuously alongside the Sequencer and publishes
transactions in regular batches.

## Proposer

The Proposer is a service responsible for publishing transactions *results* (in
the form of L2 state roots) to the L1 blockchain. This allows smart contracts
on L1 to read the state of the L2, which is necessary for cross-chain
communication and reconciliation between state changes.

## Challenger

The Challenger enforces network security by disputing invalid state roots (if
any) that have been posted by the Proposer. It monitors on-chain data and, in
the event of a suspected fraud, triggers a fault proof or another dispute
mechanism to invalidate the erroneous data.

## Software dependencies

| [git](https://git-scm.com/)                                   | `^2`     | `git --version`       |
| [go](https://go.dev/)                                         | `^1.21`  | `go version`          |
| [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)                                | `^20`    | `node --version`      |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `^8`     | `pnpm --version`      |
| [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) | `^0.2.0` | `forge --version`     |
| [make](https://linux.die.net/man/1/make)                      | `^3`     | `make --version`      |
| [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)                            | `^1.6`   | `jq --version`        |

### Notes on specific dependencies

#### `node`

We recommend using the latest LTS version of Node.js (currently v20).
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a useful tool that can help you
manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine. You may experience
unexpected errors on older versions of Node.js.

#### `foundry`

It's recommended to use the scripts in the monorepo's `package.json` for
managing `foundry` to ensure you're always working with the correct version.
This approach simplifies the installation, update, and version checking
process.
