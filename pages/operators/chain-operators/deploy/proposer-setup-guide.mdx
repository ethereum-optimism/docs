# Spinning up the proposer

After you have [spun up your sequencer](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node), you need to attach a proposer to post your L2 state roots data back onto L1 so we can prove withdrawal validity. The proposer is a critical component that enables trustless L2-to-L1 messaging and creates the authoritative view of L2 state from L1's perspective.

This guide assumes you already have a functioning sequencer and the necessary L1 contracts deployed using [`op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer). If you haven't set up your sequencer yet, please refer to the [sequencer guide](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node) first.

To see configuration info for the proposer, check out the [configuration page](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/proposer).

## Understanding the proposer's role

The proposer (`op-proposer`) serves as a crucial bridge between your L2 chain and L1. Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **State commitment**: Proposing L2 state roots to L1 at regular intervals
*   **Withdrawal enablement**: Providing the necessary commitments for users to prove and finalize withdrawals

The proposer creates dispute games via the `DisputeGameFactory` contract.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your proposer, ensure you have:

**Running infrastructure:**

*   An operational sequencer node
*   Access to a L1 RPC endpoint

**Network information:**

*   Your L2 chain ID and network configuration
*   L1 network details (chain ID, RPC endpoints)

## Software installation

### Build from source

Clone and build `op-proposer`

```bash
# If you don't already have the optimism repository from the sequencer setup
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism

# Checkout the latest release tag
git checkout op-proposer/v1.10.0

# Build op-proposer
cd op-proposer
just

# Binary will be available at ./bin/op-proposer
```

<Callout type="info">
  This uses `op-proposer/v1.10.0` which is compatible with op-node/v1.13.3 and op-geth/v1.101511.0 from [spinning up the sequencer guide](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node).
  Always check the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) for compatibility.
</Callout>

### Verify installation

Run this command to verify the installation.

```bash
./bin/op-proposer --version
```

## Configuration setup

### 1. Organize your workspace

at the same level as your sequencer from the \[sequencer tutorial]\(link-to-the sequencer tutorial):

```bash
# Create proposer directory at the same level as your sequencer
mkdir proposer-node
cd proposer-node

# Create scripts directory
mkdir scripts
```

### 2. Extract DisputeGameFactory address

Extract the `DisputeGameFactory` contract address from your op-deployer output:

```bash
# Navigate to proposer directory
cd proposer-node

# Copy the state.json from .deployer directory created while using op-deployer
# Update the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
cp ../.deployer/state.json .

# Extract the DisputeGameFactory address
GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].DisputeGameFactoryProxy')
echo "DisputeGameFactory Address: $GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS"
```

<Callout type="info">
  The proposer only needs the `DisputeGameFactory` address to submit proposals.
  The `GAME_TYPE=0` represents the standard fault proof game type.
</Callout>

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create your `.env` file with the actual values:

```bash
# Create .env file with your actual values
# L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URL
L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

# L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
L2_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547

# Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS

# Private key - Replace with your actual private key
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

# Proposer configuration
PROPOSAL_INTERVAL=3600s
GAME_TYPE=0
POLL_INTERVAL=20s

# RPC configuration
PROPOSER_RPC_PORT=8560
```

**Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values!

### 4. Get your private key

Get a private key from your wallet.

## Proposer configuration

Create `scripts/start-proposer.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source .env

# Path to the op-proposer binary we built
../optimism/op-proposer/bin/op-proposer \
  --poll-interval=$POLL_INTERVAL \
  --rpc.port=$PROPOSER_RPC_PORT \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --rollup-rpc=$ROLLUP_RPC_URL \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY \
  --game-factory-address=$GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  --game-type=$GAME_TYPE \
  --proposal-interval=$PROPOSAL_INTERVAL \
  --num-confirmations=1 \
  --resubmission-timeout=30s \
  --wait-node-sync=true \
  --log.level=info
```

Your final directory structure should look like:

```bash
~/
├── optimism/               # Contains op-proposer binary
├── sequencer-node/         # Your sequencer setup
├── .deployer/              # From op-deployer
│   └── state.json
└── proposer-node/          # Your proposer working directory
    ├── state.json          # Copied from .deployer
    ├── .env
    └── scripts/
        └── start-proposer.sh
```

## Starting the proposer

### 1. Verify prerequisites

Ensure your sequencer and op-node are running:

```bash

# Test L1 connectivity
# Note: Make sure you have exported these environment variables to your current shell session:
# export L1_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY"
# export L2_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545"  
# export ROLLUP_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8547"

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $L1_RPC_URL

# Test L2 connectivity  
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $L2_RPC_URL

# Test rollup node connectivity
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' \
  $ROLLUP_RPC_URL
```

### 2. Start the proposer

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/start-proposer.sh

# Start the proposer
./scripts/start-proposer.sh
```

## Verification

Verify your proposer is working correctly:

### Check proposer status

```bash

# Monitor proposal activity
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_outputAtBlock","params":["latest"],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8547

# Check if your proposer address has enough ETH for gas
# (Replace with your actual proposer address)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xYOUR_PROPOSER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' \
  $L1_RPC_URL
```

Your proposer is now operational!
