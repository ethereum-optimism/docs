# OP Stack smart contract deployment

<Callout type="warning">
This page is out of date and shows the legacy method for smart contract deployment.
For the latest recommended method, use [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer).
</Callout>

The following guide shows you how to deploy the OP Stack L1 smart contracts.
The primary development branch is `develop`, however **you should only deploy
official contract releases**. You can visit the [smart contract overview](/stack/smart-contracts#official-releases)
for the official release versions. Changes to the smart contracts are
generally not considered backwards compatible.

## Deployment configuration

Deploying your OP Stack contracts requires creating a deployment configuration
JSON file. You will create a new deployment configuration file in the following
monorepo subdirectory: [packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config)
For the full set of deployment configuration options and their meanings, you
can see the [rollup deployment configuration page](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/rollup).

For a detailed explanation of the configuration options and their meanings, refer to the [rollup deployment configuration page](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/rollup).

## Using `op-deployer`

The recommended way to deploy the L1 smart contracts is with the `op-deployer` tool.
Follow the steps in this [section](/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup#using-op-deployer) to learn how it works.


## Best practices

Production users should deploy their L1 contracts from a contracts release.
All contracts releases are on git tags with the following format:
`op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`. If you're deploying a new standard chain, you should
deploy the latest Optimism Governance approved release of the L1 smart contracts with [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer). This will only initially deploy with permissioned dispute games
enabled.
Starting with permissioned fault proofs gives chain operators time to get comfortable
running the additional infrastructure requirements: [op-challenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-challenger) and
[monitoring](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/tree/main). There are also
additional changes to the economics of operating a permissionless fault proof that chain operators should fully understand.
