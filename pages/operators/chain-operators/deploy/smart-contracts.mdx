# Overview

This guide outlines the process for deploying the OP Stack L1 smart contracts using `op-deployer`.

Deploying OP Stack L1 contracts is a critical step in setting up your rollup.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always deploy from official contract releases. You can find official release versions in the
  [smart contract overview](/stack/smart-contracts#official-releases). Contract changes are
  generally not considered backwards compatible.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Install op-deployer

  First, install the `op-deployer` tool following the [installation instructions](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation).

  ### Create an intent file

  Generate an intent file that defines your chain configuration:

  ```bash
  op-deployer init \
    --l1-chain-id <chain ID of your L1> \
    --l2-chain-ids <comma-separated list of chain IDs for your L2s> \
    --workdir .deployer \
    --intent-type <standard|custom|standard-overrides>
  ```

  Customize the generated intent file according to your requirements. See the [op-deployer configuration guide](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#understanding-the-intenttoml-fields) for details.

  ### Deploy the contracts

  Execute the deployment:

  ```bash
  op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer --l1-rpc-url <rpc-url> --private-key <private key hex>
  ```

  ### Verify contract source code (Optional)

  Verify your deployed contracts on block explorers:

  ```bash
  op-deployer verify \
    --l1-rpc-url <l1 rpc url> \
    --etherscan-api-key <your free etherscan api key>
  ```

  ### Generate chain configuration files

  Generate the necessary configuration files for your L2 node:

  ```bash
  op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/genesis.json
  op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/rollup.json
  ```
</Steps>

## Contract versioning

The OP Stack follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) for contract releases:

*   **Major (X):** Breaking changes that require coordination, such as Ecotone or the Fault Proof System
*   **Minor (Y):** New features or improvements that maintain backwards compatibility
*   **Patch (Z):** Bug fixes and minor improvements

Contract releases are tagged in the repository as `op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`.

<Callout type="info">
  For standard chains intended to join the Superchain, always use the latest Optimism Governance approved
  release. You can find these in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry).
</Callout>

## Version compatibility

When selecting a contract version, consider:

*   L2 Client compatibility: Ensure your chosen contract version is compatible with the op-geth and op-node versions you plan to use
*   Feature requirements: Different versions support different features (e.g., only v2.0.0+ supports permissionless fault proofs)
*   Security updates: Always prefer the latest patch version within your chosen major.minor version

## Next Steps

*   Learn how to [create your genesis file](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/genesis).
*   See all [configuration options](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/rollup) and example configurations.
