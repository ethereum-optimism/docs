# Spinning up the batcher

After you have spun up your [sequencer](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node), you need to configure a batcher to submit L2 transaction batches to L1. The batcher is a critical component that ensures L2 transaction data is available on L1 for data availability and enables users to reconstruct the L2 state.

This guide assumes you already have a functioning sequencer and the necessary L1 contracts deployed using [`op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer). If you haven't set up your sequencer yet, please refer to the [sequencer guide](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node) first.

## Understanding the batcher's role

The batcher (`op-batcher`) serves as a crucial component that bridges your L2 chain data to L1. Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **Batch submission**: Collecting L2 transactions and submitting them as batches to L1
*   **Data availability**: Ensuring L2 transaction data is available on L1 for verification
*   **Cost optimization**: Compressing and efficiently packing transaction data to minimize L1 costs
*   **Channel management**: Managing data channels for optimal batch submission timing

The batcher reads transaction data from your sequencer and submits compressed batches to the `BatchInbox` contract on L1.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your batcher, ensure you have:

**Running infrastructure:**

*   An operational sequencer node
*   Access to a L1 RPC endpoint

**Network information:**

*   Your L2 chain ID and network configuration
*   L1 network details (chain ID, RPC endpoints)
*   `BatchInbox` contract address from your deployment

## Software installation

### Finding the current stable releases

To ensure you're using the latest compatible versions of OP Stack components, always check the official [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases).

Look for the latest `op-batcher/v*` release that's compatible with your sequencer setup.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide uses `op-batcher/v1.13.1` which is compatible with op-node/v1.13.3 and op-geth/v1.101511.0 from the sequencer setup.
  Always check the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) for compatibility information.
</Callout>

### Build from source

Clone and build op-batcher:

```bash
# If you don't already have the optimism repository from the sequencer setup
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism

# Checkout the latest release tag
git checkout op-batcher/v1.13.1

# Build op-batcher
cd op-batcher
just

# Binary will be available at ./bin/op-batcher
```

### Verify installation

Run this command to verify the installation:

```bash
./bin/op-batcher --version
```

### Docker alternative (For containerized environments)

If you prefer containerized deployment, you can use the official Docker images.

### Complete Docker setup guide

<details>
  <summary>Complete Docker setup guide</summary>

  If you choose the Docker approach, you'll need to:

  1.  **Set up directory structure and copy configuration files:**

  ```bash
  # Create your batcher working directory
  mkdir ~/batcher-node
  cd ~/batcher-node

  # Copy configuration files from op-deployer output
  # Note: Adjust the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
  cp ~/.deployer/state.json .

  # Extract the BatchInbox address
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].systemConfigProxyAddress')
  echo "BatchInbox Address: $BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS"
  ```

  2.  **Create environment variables file:**

  ```bash
  # Create .env file with your actual values
  cat > .env << 'EOF'
  # L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URLs
  L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

  # L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
  L2_RPC_URL=http://sequencer-node:8545
  ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://sequencer-node:8547

  # Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS

  # Private key - Replace with your actual private key
  BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

  # Batcher configuration
  POLL_INTERVAL=1s
  SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN=6
  NUM_CONFIRMATIONS=1
  SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT=3
  RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=30s
  MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION=25

  # RPC configuration
  BATCHER_RPC_PORT=8548
  EOF
  ```

  **Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values.

  3.  **Create docker-compose.yml:**

  <Callout type="info">
    This configuration assumes your sequencer is running in a Docker container named `sequencer-node` on the same `op-stack` network. 
    Make sure your sequencer is running before starting the batcher.
  </Callout>

  ```yaml
  version: '3.8'

services:
  op-batcher:
    image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-batcher:v1.13.1
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    working_dir: /workspace
    ports:
      - "8548:8548"
    env_file:
      - .env
    command:
      - "op-batcher"
      - "--l2-eth-rpc=${L2_RPC_URL}"
      - "--rollup-rpc=${ROLLUP_RPC_URL}"
      - "--poll-interval=${POLL_INTERVAL}"
      - "--sub-safety-margin=${SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN}"
      - "--num-confirmations=${NUM_CONFIRMATIONS}"
      - "--safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=${SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT}"
      - "--resubmission-timeout=${RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT}"
      - "--rpc.addr=0.0.0.0"
      - "--rpc.port=${BATCHER_RPC_PORT}"
      - "--rpc.enable-admin"
      - "--max-channel-duration=${MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION}"
      - "--l1-eth-rpc=${L1_RPC_URL}"
      - "--private-key=${BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY}"
      - "--batch-type=1"
      - "--data-availability-type=blobs"
      - "--compress"
      - "--log.level=info"
    restart: unless-stopped
  ```

  4.  **Start the batcher service:**

  ```bash
  # Make sure your sequencer network exists
  docker network create op-stack 2>/dev/null || true

  # Start the batcher
  docker-compose up -d

  # View logs
  docker-compose logs -f op-batcher
  ````

  5.  **Verify batcher is running:**

  ```bash
  # Check batcher RPC is responding
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[],"id":1}' \
    http://localhost:8548

  # Check container status
  docker-compose ps
  ```

  6.  **Final directory structure:**

  ```bash
  ~/batcher-node/
  ├── state.json             # Copied from ~/.deployer/
  ├── .env                   # Environment variables
  └── docker-compose.yml     # Docker configuration
  ```
</details>

<Callout type="warning">
  The rest of this guide assumes you're using the **build-from-source** approach.
  If you chose Docker, refer to the collapsible section.
</Callout>

## Configuration setup

### 1. Organize your workspace

Create your batcher working directory:

```bash
# Create batcher directory at the same level as your sequencer
mkdir batcher-node
cd batcher-node

# Create scripts directory
mkdir scripts
```

Your final directory structure should look like:

```bash
~/
├── optimism/               # Contains op-batcher binary
├── sequencer-node/         # Your sequencer setup
├── proposer-node/          # Your proposer setup
├── .deployer/             # From op-deployer
│   └── state.json
└── batcher-node/          # Your batcher working directory
    ├── state.json         # Copied from .deployer
    ├── .env
    └── scripts/
        └── start-batcher.sh
```

### 2. Extract `BatchInbox` address

Extract the `BatchInbox` contract address from your op-deployer output:

```bash
# Navigate to batcher directory
cd ~/batcher-node

# Copy the deployment state file from op-deployer
# Update the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
cp ../.deployer/state.json .

# Extract the BatchInbox address
BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].systemConfigProxyAddress')
echo "BatchInbox Address: $BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS"
```

<Callout type="info">
  The batcher submits transaction batches to the `BatchInbox` contract on L1. This contract is responsible for accepting and storing L2 transaction data.
</Callout>

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create your `.env` file with the actual values:

```bash
# Create .env file with your actual values
# L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URL
L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

# L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
L2_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547

# Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS

# Private key - Replace with your actual private key
BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

# Batcher configuration
POLL_INTERVAL=1s
SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN=6
NUM_CONFIRMATIONS=1
SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT=3
RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=30s
MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION=25

# RPC configuration
BATCHER_RPC_PORT=8548
```

**Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values!

### 4. Get your private key

Get a private key from your wallet that will be used for submitting batches to L1. This account needs sufficient ETH to pay for L1 gas costs.

<Callout type="warning">
  The batcher account needs to be funded with ETH on L1 to pay for batch submission transactions. Monitor this account's balance regularly as it will consume ETH for each batch submission.
</Callout>

## Batcher configuration

Create `scripts/start-batcher.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source .env

# Path to the op-batcher binary we built
../optimism/op-batcher/bin/op-batcher \
  --l2-eth-rpc=$L2_RPC_URL \
  --rollup-rpc=$ROLLUP_RPC_URL \
  --poll-interval=$POLL_INTERVAL \
  --sub-safety-margin=$SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN \
  --num-confirmations=$NUM_CONFIRMATIONS \
  --safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=$SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT \
  --resubmission-timeout=$RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=$BATCHER_RPC_PORT \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --max-channel-duration=$MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --batch-type=1 \
  --data-availability-type=blobs \
  --compress \
  --log.level=info
```

*   **`--batch-type`**: Type of batch encoding (1 for span batches, 0 for singular batches)
*   **`--data-availability-type`**: Whether to use blobs or calldata for data availability
*   **`--compress`**: Enable compression to reduce L1 data costs

## Starting the batcher

### 1. Verify prerequisites

Ensure your sequencer and rollup node are running:

<Steps>
  ### Test L1 connectivity

  ```bash
  # Note: Make sure you have exported these environment variables to your current shell session:
  # export L1_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY"
  # export L2_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545"  
  # export ROLLUP_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8547"

  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $L1_RPC_URL
  ```

  ### Test L2 connectivity

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $L2_RPC_URL
  ```

  ### Test rollup node connectivity

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $ROLLUP_RPC_URL
  ```
</Steps>

### 2. Start the batcher

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/start-batcher.sh

# Start the batcher
./scripts/start-batcher.sh
```

## Verification

Verify your batcher is working correctly:

### Check batcher status

```bash
# Check batcher RPC is responding
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8548

# Monitor batch submission activity (check L1 for recent transactions from your batcher address)
# Replace with your actual batcher address
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionCount","params":["0xYOUR_BATCHER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' \
  $L1_RPC_URL

# Check if your batcher address has enough ETH for gas
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xYOUR_BATCHER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' \
  $L1_RPC_URL
```
