# Spinning up the batcher

After you have spun up your [sequencer](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node), you need to configure a batcher to submit L2 transaction batches to L1. The batcher is a critical component that ensures L2 transaction data is available on L1 for data availability and enables users to reconstruct the L2 state.

This guide assumes you already have a functioning sequencer and the necessary L1 contracts deployed using [`op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer). If you haven't set up your sequencer yet, please refer to the [sequencer guide](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/sequencer-node) first.

## Understanding the batcher's role

The batcher (`op-batcher`) serves as a crucial component that bridges your L2 chain data to L1. Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **Batch submission**: Collecting L2 transactions and submitting them as batches to L1
*   **Data availability**: Ensuring L2 transaction data is available on L1 for verification
*   **Cost optimization**: Compressing and efficiently packing transaction data to minimize L1 costs
*   **Channel management**: Managing data channels for optimal batch submission timing

The batcher reads transaction data from your sequencer and submits compressed batches to the `BatchInbox` contract on L1.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your batcher, ensure you have:

**Running infrastructure:**

*   An operational sequencer node
*   Access to a L1 RPC endpoint

**Network information:**

*   Your L2 chain ID and network configuration
*   L1 network details (chain ID, RPC endpoints)
*   `BatchInbox` contract address from your deployment

## Software installation

### Finding the current stable releases

To ensure you're using the latest compatible versions of OP Stack components, always check the official [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases).

Look for the latest `op-batcher/v*` release that's compatible with your sequencer setup.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide uses `op-batcher/v1.13.1` which is compatible with op-node/v1.13.3 and op-geth/v1.101511.0 from the sequencer setup.
  Always check the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) for compatibility information.
</Callout>

### Build from source

Clone and build op-batcher:

```bash
# If you don't already have the optimism repository from the sequencer setup
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism

# Checkout the latest release tag
git checkout op-batcher/v1.13.1

# Build op-batcher
cd op-batcher
just

# Binary will be available at ./bin/op-batcher
```

### Verify installation

Run this command to verify the installation:

```bash
./bin/op-batcher --version
```

### Docker alternative (For containerized environments)

If you prefer containerized deployment, you can use the official Docker images.

### Complete Docker setup guide

  <summary>Complete Docker setup guide</summary>

  If you choose the Docker approach, you'll need to:

  1.  **Set up directory structure and copy configuration files:**

  ```bash
  # Create your batcher working directory
  mkdir ~/batcher-node
  cd ~/batcher-node

  # Copy configuration files from op-deployer output
  # Note: Adjust the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
  cp ~/.deployer/state.json .

  # Extract the BatchInbox address
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].SystemConfigProxy')
  echo "BatchInbox Address: $BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS"
  ```

  2.  **Create environment variables file:**

  ```bash
  # Create .env file with your actual values
  cat > .env << 'EOF'
  # L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URLs
  L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

  # L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
  L2_RPC_URL=http://op-geth:8545
  ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://op-node:8547

  # Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS

  # Private key - Replace with your actual private key
  BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

  # Batcher configuration
  POLL_INTERVAL=1s
  SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN=6
  NUM_CONFIRMATIONS=1
  SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT=3
  RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=30s
  MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION=25

  # RPC configuration
  BATCHER_RPC_PORT=8548
  EOF
  ```

  **Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values.

  3.  **Create docker-compose.yml:**

  <Callout type="info">
    This configuration assumes your sequencer is running in a Docker container named `sequencer-node` on the same `op-stack` network. 
    Make sure your sequencer is running before starting the batcher.
  </Callout>

  ```yaml

services:
  op-batcher:
    image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-batcher:v1.13.1
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    working_dir: /workspace
    ports:
      - "8548:8548"
    env_file:
      - .env
    command:
      - "op-batcher"
      - "--l2-eth-rpc=${L2_RPC_URL}"
      - "--rollup-rpc=${ROLLUP_RPC_URL}"
      - "--poll-interval=${POLL_INTERVAL}"
      - "--sub-safety-margin=${SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN}"
      - "--num-confirmations=${NUM_CONFIRMATIONS}"
      - "--safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=${SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT}"
      - "--resubmission-timeout=${RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT}"
      - "--rpc.addr=0.0.0.0"
      - "--rpc.port=${BATCHER_RPC_PORT}"
      - "--rpc.enable-admin"
      - "--max-channel-duration=${MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION}"
      - "--l1-eth-rpc=${L1_RPC_URL}"
      - "--private-key=${BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY}"
      - "--batch-type=1"
      - "--data-availability-type=blobs"
      - "--compress"
      - "--log.level=info"
    restart: unless-stopped
  ```

  4.  **Start the batcher service:**

  ```bash
  # Make sure your sequencer network exists
  docker network create op-stack 2>/dev/null || true

  # Start the batcher
  docker-compose up -d

  # View logs
  docker-compose logs -f op-batcher
  ````

  5.  **Verify batcher is running:**

  ```bash
  # Check batcher RPC is responding
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[],"id":1}' \
    http://localhost:8548

  # Check container status
  docker-compose ps
  ```

  6.  **Final directory structure:**

  ```bash
  ~/batcher-node/
  ├── state.json             # Copied from ~/.deployer/
  ├── .env                   # Environment variables
  └── docker-compose.yml     # Docker configuration
  ```

  The rest of this guide assumes you're using the **build-from-source** approach.
