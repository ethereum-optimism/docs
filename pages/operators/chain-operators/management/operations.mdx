# Rollup operations
This guide reviews the basics of rollup operations, such as how to start your rollup, stop your rollup, get your rollup config, and add nodes.

## Stopping your rollup

An orderly shutdown is done in the reverse order to the order in which components were started:
<Steps>
### To stop the batcher, use this command:

    ```sh
    curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_stopBatcher","params":[]}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8548 | jq
    ```

    This way the batcher knows to save any data it has cached to L1.
    Wait until you see `Batch Submitter stopped` in batcher's output before you stop the process.

### Stop `op-proposer`

To stop the proposer, terminate the process directly. This can be done by:

*   Pressing **Ctrl+C** in the terminal running the process
*   Using system commands like `kill -TERM <pid>` to stop the process gracefully

Ensure that the proposer process has terminated completely before proceeding to stop other components.

### Stop `op-node`
    This component is stateless, so you can just stop the process.

### Stop `op-geth`
    Make sure you use **CTRL-C** to avoid database corruption. If Geth stops unexpectedly the database can be corrupted. This is known as an "[unclean shutdown](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/databases#unclean-shutdowns)" and it can lead to a variety of problems for the node when it is restarted.
</Steps>

## Starting your rollup

To restart the blockchain, use the same order of components you did when you initialized it.
<Steps>
### Start `op-geth`
### Start `op-node`
### Start `op-batcher`

    If `op-batcher` is still running and you just stopped it using RPC, you can start it with this command:

    ```sh
    curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[]}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8548 | jq   
    ```
### Start `op-proposer`

Start the proposer using the appropriate command. Here's an example:

  ```sh
  ./bin/op-proposer \
    --poll-interval=12s \
    --rpc.port=8560 \
    --rollup-rpc=http://localhost:8547 \
    --l2oo-address=0xYourL2OutputOracleAddress \
    --private-key=$PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL
  ```
  | Parameter     | Description                                                    |
  | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | poll-interval | How often to check for new output proposals (recommended: 12s) |
  | rpc.port      | Local RPC port for the proposer service                        |
  | l2oo-address  | The L2 Output Oracle contract address (0x-prefixed hex)        |
  | private-key   | Private key for signing proposals                              |
  | l1-eth-rpc    | L1 network RPC endpoint URL                                    |
</Steps>
<Callout type="info">
Synchronization takes time

`op-batcher` might have warning messages similar to:

```
WARN [03-21|14:13:55.248] Error calculating L2 block range         err="failed to get sync status: Post \"http://localhost:8547\": context deadline exceeded"
WARN [03-21|14:13:57.328] Error calculating L2 block range         err="failed to get sync status: Post \"http://localhost:8547\": context deadline exceeded"
```

This means that `op-node` is not yet synchronized up to the present time.
Just wait until it is.

</Callout>

## Getting your rollup config

Use this tool to get your rollup config from `op-node`. This will only work if your chain is **already** in the [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json) and `op-node` has been updated to pull those changes in from the registry.

<Callout type="warning">
This script will NOT work for chain operators trying to generate this data in order to submit it to the registry.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Get your rollup config from `op-node`

You'll need to run this tool:

```
./bin/op-node networks dump-rollup-config --network=op-sepolia

}
```
### Check the flags
Ensure that you are using the appropriate flag. 
The `--network=op-sepolia` flag allows the tool to pick up the appropriate data from the registry, and uses the OPChains mapping under the hood.

</Steps>

## Adding nodes

To add nodes to the rollup, you need to initialize `op-node` and `op-geth`, similar to what you did for the first node.
You should *not* add an `op-batcher` because there should be only one.
<Steps>
### Configure the OS and prerequisites as you did for the first node

### Build the Optimism monorepo and `op-geth` as you did for the first node

### Copy from the first node these files:

    ```bash
    ~/op-geth/genesis.json
    ~/optimism/op-node/rollup.json
    ```

### Create a new `jwt.txt` file as a shared secret:

    ```bash
    cd ~/op-geth
    openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
    cp jwt.txt ~/optimism/op-node
    ```

### Initialize the new op-geth:

    ```bash
    cd ~/op-geth
    ./build/bin/geth init --datadir=./datadir ./genesis.json
    ```

### Turn on peer to peer synchronization to enable L2 nodes to synchronize directly
If you do it this way, you won't have to wait until the transactions are written to L1.
    If you already have peer to peer synchronization, add the new node to the `--p2p.static` list so it can synchronize.

### Start `op-geth` (using the same command line you used on the initial node)
<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Make sure to configure the `--rollup.sequencerhttp` flag to point to your sequencer node. This HTTP endpoint is crucial because `op-geth` will route `eth_sendRawTransaction` calls to this URL. The OP Stack does not currently have a public mempool, so configuring this is required if you want your node to support transaction submission.
</Callout>

### Start `op-node` (using the same command line you used on the initial node)
</Steps>
