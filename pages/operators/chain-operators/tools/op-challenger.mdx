# How to configure challenger for your chain

This guide provides a walkthrough of setting up the configuration and monitoring options for `op-challenger`. See the [OP-Challenger Explainer](/stack/fault-proofs/challenger) for a general overview of this fault proofs feature.&#x20;

<Steps>
  ### Build the executable

  *   Clone the monorepo

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
  ```

  *   Check out the [latest release of `op-challenger`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) and use the commit to deploy. Alternatively, chain operators can use the prebuilt challenger docker images included in the release notes.
      If a Docker image is used, it already comes with `op-program` server and an executable for Cannon embedded, so the Cannon bin doesn't need to be specified.

      ```bash
      git checkout op-challenger/vX.Y.Z
      ```

  <Callout type="warning">
    Chain operators need to specify the arguments and `op-program` server if `op-challenger` is running outside of Docker, but there's a Cannon server option which points to `op-program`'s executable.
  </Callout>

  *   Build challenger

  ```bash
  cd optimism
  pnpm install
  make op-challenger
  ```

  ### Configure challenger

  *   Configure challenger with the required flags. Tip: Use the `op-challenger --help` to view all subcommands, command line, and environment variable options.
  *   The example config file below shows the flags to configure in this step:

  ```docker
  challenger:
      user: "1000"
      image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-challenger:v0.2.11
      command:
        - "op-challenger"
        - "--l1-eth-rpc=http://sepolia-el-1:8545"
        - "--l1-beacon=http://sepolia-cl-1:5051"
        - "--l2-eth-rpc=http://op-sepolia-el-1:8545"
        - "--rollup-rpc=http://op-sepolia-cl-1:5051"
        - "--selective-claim-resolution"
        - "--private-key=...."
        - "--network=..."
        - "--datadir=/data"
        - "--cannon-prestates-url=..."
      volumes:
        - "./challenger-data:/data"
  ```

  #### `--l1-eth-rpc`

  *   This is the HTTP provider URL for a standard L1 node, can be a full node. `op-challenger` will be sending many requests, so chain operators need a node that is trusted and can easily handle many transactions.
  *   Note: Challenger has a lot of money, and it will spend it if it needs to interact with games. That might risk not defending games or challenging games correctly, so chain operators should really trust the nodes being pointed at Challenger.

  #### `--l1-beacon`

  *   This is needed just to get blobs from.
  *   In some instances, chain operators might need a blob archiver or L1 consensus node configured not to prune blobs:
      *   If the chain is proposing regularly, a blob archiver isn't needed. There's only a small window in the blob retention period that games can be played.
      *   If the chain doesn't post a valid output root in 18 days, then a blob archiver running a challenge game is needed. If the actor gets pushed to the bottom of the game, it could lose if it's the only one protecting the chain.

  #### `--l2-eth-rpc`

  *   This needs to be `op-geth` archive node, with `debug` enabled.
  *   Technically doesn't need to go to bedrock, but needs to have access to the start of any game that is still in progress.

  #### `--rollup-rpc`

  *   This needs to be an `op-node` archive node because challenger needs access to output roots from back when the games start. See below for important configuration details:

  1.  Safe Head Database (SafeDB) Configuration for op-node:

      *   The `op-node` behind the `op-conductor` must have the SafeDB enabled to ensure it is not stateless.
      *   To enable SafeDB, set the `--safedb.path` value in your configuration. This specifies the file path used to persist safe head update data.
      *   Example Configuration:

          ```
          --safedb.path <path-to-safe-head-db>   # Replace <path-to-safe-head-db> with your actual path
          ```

          <Callout type="info">
          If this path is not set, the SafeDB feature will be disabled.
          </Callout>

      2.  Ensuring Historical Data Availability:

      *   Both `op-node` and `op-geth` must have data from the start of the games to maintain network consistency and allow nodes to reference historical state and transactions.
      *   For `op-node`: Configure it to maintain a sufficient history of blockchain data locally or use an archive node.
      *   For `op-geth`: Similarly, configure to store or access historical data.
      *   Example Configuration:

          ```
          op-node \
          --rollup-rpc <op-node-archive-node-url> \
          --safedb.path <path-to-safe-head-db>
          ```

      <Callout type="info">
      Replace `<op-node-archive-node-url>` with the URL of your archive node and `<path-to-safe-head-db>` with the desired path for storing SafeDB data.
      </Callout>

  #### `--private-key`

  *   Chain operators must specify a private key or use something else (like `op-signer`).
  *   This uses the same transaction manager arguments as `op-node` , batcher, and proposer, so chain operators can choose one of the following options:
      *   a mnemonic
      *   a private key
      *   `op-signer` endpoints

  #### `--network`

  *   This identifies the L2 network `op-challenger` is running for, e.g., `op-sepolia` or `op-mainnet`.
  *   When using the `--network` flag, the `--game-factory-address` will be automatically pulled from the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json).
  *   When cannon is executed, challenger needs the roll-up config and the L2 Genesis, which is op-geth's Genesis file. Both files are automatically loaded when Cannon Network is used, but custom networks will need to specify both Cannon L2 Genesis and Cannon rollup config.
  *   For custom networks not in the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json), the `--game-factory-address` and rollup must be specified, as follows:

      ```
      --cannon-rollup-config rollup.json  \
      --cannon-l2-genesis genesis-l2.json \
      # use this if running challenger outside of the docker image
      --cannon-server ./op-program/bin/op-program \
      # json or url, version of op-program deployed on chain
      # if you use the wrong one, you will lose the game
      # if you deploy your own contracts, you specify the hash, the root of the json file
      # op mainnet are tagged versions of op-program
      # make reproducible prestate
      # challenger verifies that onchain
       --cannon-prestate ./op-program/bin/prestate.json \
      # load the game factory address from system config or superchain registry
      # point the game factory address at the dispute game factory proxy
       --game-factory-address
      ```

  <Callout type="warning">
    These options vary based on which `--network` is specified. Chain operators always need to specify a way to load prestates and must also specify the cannon-server whenever the docker image isn't being used.
  </Callout>

  #### `--datadir`

  *   This is a directory that `op-challenger` can write to and store whatever data it needs.  It will manage this directory to add or remove data as needed under that directory.
  *   If running in docker, it should point to a docker volume or mountpoint, so the data isn't lost on every restart. The data can be recreated if needed but particularly if challenger has executed cannon as part of responding to a game it may mean a lot of extra processing.

  #### `--cannon-prestates-url`

  The pre-state is effectively the version of `op-program` that is deployed on chain. And chain operators must use the right version. `op-challenger` will refuse to interact with games that have a different absolute prestate hash to avoid making invalid claims. If deploying your own contracts, chain operators must specify an absolute prestate hash taken from the `make reproducible-prestate` command during contract deployment, which will also build the required prestate json file.

  All governance approved releases use a tagged version of `op-program`. These can be rebuilt by checking out the version tag and running `make reproducible-prestate`.

  *   There are two ways to specify the prestate to use:
      *   `--cannon-prestate`: specifies a path to a single Cannon pre-state Json file
      *   `--cannon-prestates-url`: specifies a URL to load pre-states from. This enables participating in games that use different prestates, for example due to a network upgrade. The prestates are stored in this directory named by their hash.
  *   Example final URL for a prestate:
      *   [https://example.com/prestates/0x031e3b504740d0b1264e8cf72b6dde0d497184cfb3f98e451c6be8b33bd3f808.json](https://example.com/prestates/0x031e3b504740d0b1264e8cf72b6dde0d497184cfb3f98e451c6be8b33bd3f808.json)
      *   This file contains the cannon memory state.

  <Callout type="warning">
    Challenger will refuse to interact with any games if it doesn't have the matching prestate.
  </Callout>

  ### Execute challenger

  The final step is to execute challenger with the required flags. It will look something like this (but with required flags added):

  ```bash
  ./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger \
    --trace-type cannon \
    --l1-eth-rpc http://localhost:8545 \
    --rollup-rpc http://localhost:9546 \
    --game-factory-address $DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY \
    --datadir temp/challenger-data \
    --cannon-rollup-config .devnet/rollup.json  \
    --cannon-l2-genesis .devnet/genesis-l2.json \
    --cannon-bin ./cannon/bin/cannon \
    --cannon-server ./op-program/bin/op-program \
    --cannon-prestate ./op-program/bin/prestate.json \
    --l2-eth-rpc http://localhost:9545 \
    --mnemonic "test test test test test test test test test test test junk" \
    --hd-path "m/44'/60'/0'/0/8" \
  ```

  ### Test and debug challenger (optional)

  This is an optional step to use `op-challenger` subcommands, which allow chain operators to interact with the Fault Proof System onchain for testing and debugging purposes. For example, it is possible to test and explore the system in the following ways:

  *   create games yourself, and it doesn't matter if the games are valid or invalid.
  *   perform moves in games and then claim and resolve things.

  Here's the list of op-challenger subcommands:

  | subcommand      | description                                              |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `list-games`    | List the games created by a dispute game factory         |
  | `list-claims`   | List the claims in a dispute game                        |
  | `list-credits`  | List the credits in a dispute game                       |
  | `create-game`   | Creates a dispute game via the factory                   |
  | `move`          | Creates and sends a move transaction to the dispute game |
  | `resolve`       | Resolves the specified dispute game if possible          |
  | `resolve-claim` | Resolves the specified claim if possible                 |

  Additionally, chain operators should consider running `op-dispute-mon`. It's an incredibly useful security monitoring service to keep an eye on games, basically giving chain operators visibility into all the status of the games for the last 28 days.
  Chain operators can easily create their grafana dashboard for Dispute Monitor using the following json file: [Download the Dispute Monitor JSON](/resources/grafana/dispute-monitor-1718214549035.json).
