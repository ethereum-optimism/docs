# Running a Local Development Environment

<Callout type="info">
  This guide is currently under active development. If you run into any issues, please open an issue on
  [Github](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
</Callout>

This tutorial is **designed for developers** who want to learn about the OP Stack by spinning up a local OP Stack devnet.
You'll perform the full deployment process, and **you'll end up with your very own OP Stack devnet**.

It's useful to understand what each of these components does before
you start deploying your chain. To learn about the different components please
read the [deployment overview page](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/overview).

You can use this devnet to experiment and perform tests, or you can choose to modify the chain to adapt it to your own needs.
**The OP Stack is free and open source software licensed entirely under the MIT license**. You don't need permission from
anyone to modify or deploy the stack in any configuration you want.

<Callout type="warning">
  Modifications to the OP Stack may prevent a chain from being able to benefit from aspects of the [Optimism
  Superchain](/superchain/superchain-explainer). Make sure to check out the [Superchain Explainer](/superchain/superchain-explainer) to learn more.

## Installing Dependencies

| Dependency                                        | Version  | Version Check Command |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) | `^27`    | `docker --version`    |
| [kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/)    | `^1.3.0` | `kurtosis version`    |

### Notes on Specific Dependencies

#### `docker`

We recommend using the latest version of Docker on Linux, or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) (a drop-in replacement
for Docker Desktop) on OSX.

#### `kurtosis`

[Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) is a tool for packaging and deploying containerized services. It's used in this tutorial to automatically deploy
your devnet in an isolated environment.

## Configure your network

Now that you've installed all the necessary dependencies, you can start configuring your network. The Kurtosis package
accepts a YAML file which configures how many network participants there are, what kind of software they're running, and
the network's topology. An example YAML file is below:

```yaml
# Check https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package for more detail.

optimism_package:
  # An array of L2 networks to run.
  chains:
    # Chains are keyed by their network name.
    rollup-1:
      # Specification of the optimism-participants in the network.
      participants:
        # Nodes are keyed by their name.
        node0:
          # EL(Execution Layer) Specific flags.
          el:
            type: op-geth
          # CL(Consensus Layer) Specific flags
          cl:
            type: op-node
        node1:
          el:
            type: op-reth
          cl:
            type: op-node
```

Save the above configuration to a file. For the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume you've saved it to `network-config.yaml`.

## Start your network

Now that you've configured your network, you can start it up using the Kurtosis CLI. Run the command below:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package --args-file ./network-config.yaml
```

This command will start up your network and deploy the OP Stack based on the configuration you created. The command will
produce a lot of output and will take about five minutes to complete. Once it's done, you'll see a message that looks like
the one below:

```

This might look complicated, but it's just a list of the services that were started up by Kurtosis. For each service, you
can see:

*   The enclave name, which identifies the services you just deployed within Kurtosis. The enclave is an isolated environment
    that runs your devnet.
*   The service's name, which you can use with the Kurtosis CLI to view its logs and interact with it.
*   The service's ports and addresses, which you can use to connect to the service.

At this point your chain is up and running. Let's move on to the next section to learn how to interact with it.

<Callout type="info">
  You can also use the Kurtosis Web UI to monitor and interact with your services by running:
  ```bash
  kurtosis web
  ```
  This will open a browser window with a dashboard showing all your running enclaves and services.
</Callout>

## Interact with your network

You now have a fully functioning OP Stack Rollup. You can connect your wallet to this chain the same way you'd connect
your wallet to any other EVM chain. You can find your node's RPC URL by running `kurtosis enclave inspect <enclave name>`.
Your enclave name is outputted at the end of the `kurtosis run` command above. The RPC url is the `rpc` port name in any
of the execution client services identified by `op-el`.

### Using pre-funded accounts on L2

<Callout type="info">
  Important: The setup script automatically pre-funds accounts on the L2 chain directly. You don't need to bridge funds from L1 to L2 to get started.
</Callout>

Your network is configured to pre-fund development addresses on L2 using the `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`
mnemonic. You can import one of the private keys from that mnemonic into your favorite wallet or use
a CLI tool like `cast`. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll use `cast` and assume you want to use the first address
generated by that mnemonic.

First, check your L2 balance to confirm you have funds:

```bash
# Find your L2 node's RPC port
# Look for a service starting with "op-el" (like op-el-1-op-geth-op-node-rollup-1) and note its RPC port
# For example: rpc: 8545/tcp -> http://127.0.0.1:33643

# Check your balance on L2
export ADDRESS="0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"  # First address from the test mnemonic
export L2_RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:<L2-RPC-PORT>"  # Replace with your actual L2 RPC port
cast balance "$ADDRESS" --rpc-url "$L2_RPC_URL"
```

You should see that this account already has ETH on L2.

### Interacting with your L2

Now that you've confirmed you have funds on L2, you can start using them to interact with your rollup:

```bash
# Example: Sending a transaction on L2
cast send --mnemonic 'test test test test test test test test test test test junk' \
    <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> \
    --value 0.01ether --rpc-url "$L2_RPC_URL"

# Example: Deploying a contract on L2 (if you have Foundry installed)
# forge create --rpc-url "$L2_RPC_URL" \
#     --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
#     <CONTRACT-NAME>
```

## See Your Rollup in Action

You can interact with your Rollup the same way you'd interact with any other EVM chain.
Send some transactions, deploy some contracts, and see what happens!
