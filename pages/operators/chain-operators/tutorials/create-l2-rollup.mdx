# Creating your own L2 rollup testnet

<Callout type="info">
Please **be prepared to set aside approximately one hour** to get everything running properly and **make sure to read through the guide carefully**.
You don't want to miss any important steps that might cause issues down the line.
</Callout>

This tutorial is **designed for developers** who want to learn about the OP Stack by spinning up an OP Stack testnet chain.
You'll walk through the full deployment process and teach you all of the components that make up the OP Stack, and **you'll end up with your very own OP Stack testnet**.

It's useful to understand what each of these components does before
you start deploying your chain. To learn about the different components please
read the [deployment overview page](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/overview). 

You can use this testnet to experiment and perform tests, or you can choose to modify the chain to adapt it to your own needs.
**The OP Stack is free and open source software licensed entirely under the MIT license**.
You don't need permission from anyone to modify or deploy the stack in any configuration you want.

<Callout type="warning">
Modifications to the OP Stack may prevent a chain from being able to benefit from aspects of the [Optimism Superchain](/superchain/superchain-explainer).
Make sure to check out the [Superchain Explainer](/superchain/superchain-explainer) to learn more.

### Notes on specific dependencies

#### `node`

We recommend using the latest LTS version of Node.js (currently v20).
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a useful tool that can help you manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.
You may experience unexpected errors on older versions of Node.js.

#### `foundry`

It's recommended to use the scripts in the monorepo's `package.json` for managing `foundry` to ensure you're always working with the correct version. This approach simplifies the installation, update, and version checking process. Make sure to clone the monorepo locally before proceeding.
#### `direnv`

Parts of this tutorial use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) as a way of loading environment variables from `.envrc` files into your shell.
This means you won't have to manually export environment variables every time you want to use them.
`direnv` only ever has access to files that you explicitly allow it to see.

After [installing `direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html), you will need to **make sure that [`direnv` is hooked into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)**.
Make sure you've followed [the guide on the `direnv` website](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), then **close your terminal and reopen it** so that the changes take effect (or `source` your config file if you know how to do that).

<Callout>
Make sure that you have correctly hooked `direnv` into your shell by modifying your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
If you haven't edited a config file then you probably haven't configured `direnv` properly (and things might not work later).
</Callout>

## Get access to a sepolia node

You'll be deploying a OP Stack Rollup chain that uses a Layer 1 blockchain to host and order transaction data.
The OP Stack Rollups were designed to use EVM Equivalent blockchains like Ethereum, OP Mainnet, or standard Ethereum testnets as their L1 chains.

**This guide uses the Sepolia testnet as an L1 chain**.
We recommend that you also use Sepolia.
You can also use other EVM-compatible blockchains, but you may run into unexpected errors.
If you want to use an alternative network, make sure to carefully review each command and replace any Sepolia-specific values with the values for your network.

Since you're deploying your OP Stack chain to Sepolia, you'll need to have access to a Sepolia node.
You can either use a node provider like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) (easier) or run your own Sepolia node (harder).

## Build the source code

You're going to be spinning up your OP Stack chain directly from source code instead of using a container system like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Although this adds a few extra steps, it means you'll have an easier time modifying the behavior of the stack if you'd like to do so.
If you want a summary of the various components you'll be using, take another look at the [What You're Going to Deploy](#what-youre-going-to-deploy) section above.

<Callout>
You're using the home directory `~/` as the work directory for this tutorial for simplicity.
You can use any directory you'd like but using the home directory will allow you to copy/paste the commands in this guide.
If you choose to use a different directory, make sure you're using the correct directory in the commands throughout this tutorial.
</Callout>

### Build the Optimism monorepo

<Steps>

{<h3>Clone the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
```

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd optimism
```

{<h3>Check out the correct branch</h3>}

<Callout>
You will be using the `tutorials/chain` branch of the Optimism Monorepo to deploy an OP Stack testnet chain during this tutorial.
This is a non-production branch that lags behind the `develop` branch.
You should **NEVER** use the `develop` or `tutorials/chain` branches in production.
</Callout>

```bash
git checkout tutorials/chain
```

{<h3>Check your dependencies</h3>}

<Callout>
Don't skip this step! Make sure you have all of the required dependencies installed before continuing.
</Callout>

Run the following script and double check that you have all of the required versions installed.
If you don't have the correct versions installed, you may run into unexpected errors.

```bash
./packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/getting-started/versions.sh
```

{<h3>Install dependencies</h3>}

```bash
pnpm install
```

{<h3>Build the various packages inside of the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
make op-node op-batcher op-proposer
pnpm build
```

</Steps>

### Build `op-geth`

<Steps>

{<h3>Clone op-geth</h3>}

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth.git
```

{<h3>Enter op-geth</h3>}

```bash
cd op-geth
```

{<h3>Build op-geth</h3>}

```bash
make geth
```

</Steps>

## Fill out environment variables

You'll need to fill out a few environment variables before you can start deploying your chain.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Duplicate the sample environment variable file</h3>}

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

{<h3>Fill out the environment variable file</h3>}

Open up the environment variable file and fill out the following variables:

| Variable Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `L1_RPC_URL`  | URL for your L1 node (a Sepolia node in this case).                                                                                                                                                          |
| `L1_RPC_KIND` | Kind of L1 RPC you're connecting to, used to inform optimal transactions receipts fetching. Valid options: `alchemy`, `quicknode`, `infura`, `parity`, `nethermind`, `debug_geth`, `erigon`, `basic`, `any`. |

</Steps>

## Generate addresses

You'll need four addresses and their private keys when setting up the chain:

*   The `Admin` address has the ability to upgrade contracts.
*   The `Batcher` address publishes Sequencer transaction data to L1.
*   The `Proposer` address publishes L2 transaction results (state roots) to L1.
*   The `Sequencer` address signs blocks on the p2p network.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Generate new addresses</h3>}

<Callout type="error">
You should **not** use the `wallets.sh` tool for production deployments.
If you are deploying an OP Stack based chain into production, you should likely be using a combination of hardware security modules and hardware wallets.
</Callout>

```bash
./packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/getting-started/wallets.sh
```

{<h3>Check the output</h3>}

Make sure that you see output that looks something like the following:

```text
Copy the following into your .envrc file:
  
# Admin address
export GS_ADMIN_ADDRESS=0x9625B9aF7C42b4Ab7f2C437dbc4ee749d52E19FC
export GS_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=0xbb93a75f64c57c6f464fd259ea37c2d4694110df57b2e293db8226a502b30a34

# Batcher address
export GS_BATCHER_ADDRESS=0xa1AEF4C07AB21E39c37F05466b872094edcf9cB1
export GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xe4d9cd91a3e53853b7ea0dad275efdb5173666720b1100866fb2d89757ca9c5a
  
# Proposer address
export GS_PROPOSER_ADDRESS=0x40E805e252D0Ee3D587b68736544dEfB419F351b
export GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2d1f265683ebe37d960c67df03a378f79a7859038c6d634a61e40776d561f8a2
  
# Sequencer address
export GS_SEQUENCER_ADDRESS=0xC06566E8Ec6cF81B4B26376880dB620d83d50Dfb
export GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2a0290473f3838dbd083a5e17783e3cc33c905539c0121f9c76614dda8a38dca
```

{<h3>Save the addresses</h3>}

Copy the output from the previous step and paste it into your `.envrc` file as directed.

{<h3>Fund the addresses</h3>}

**You will need to send ETH to the `Admin`, `Proposer`, and `Batcher` addresses.**
The exact amount of ETH required depends on the L1 network being used.
**You do not need to send any ETH to the `Sequencer` address as it does not send transactions.**

It's recommended to fund the addresses with the following amounts when using Sepolia:

*   `Admin` — 0.5 Sepolia ETH
*   `Batcher` — 0.1 Sepolia ETH
*   `Proposer` — 0.2 Sepolia ETH

**To get the required Sepolia ETH to fund the addresses, we recommend using the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs)** together with [Coinbase verification](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification).

</Steps>

## Load environment variables

Now that you've filled out the environment variable file, you need to load those variables into your terminal.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Load the variables with direnv</h3>}

<Callout>
You're about to use `direnv` to load environment variables from the `.envrc` file into your terminal.
Make sure that you've [installed `direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) and that you've properly [hooked `direnv` into your shell](#configuring-direnv).
</Callout>

Next you'll need to allow `direnv` to read this file and load the variables into your terminal using the following command.

```bash
direnv allow
```

<Callout>
WARNING: `direnv` will unload itself whenever your `.envrc` file changes.
**You *must* rerun the following command every time you change the `.envrc` file.**
</Callout>

{<h3>Confirm that the variables were loaded</h3>}

After running `direnv allow` you should see output that looks something like the following (the exact output will vary depending on the variables you've set, don't worry if it doesn't look exactly like this):

```bash
direnv: loading ~/optimism/.envrc                                                            
direnv: export +DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT +ETHERSCAN_API_KEY +GS_ADMIN_ADDRESS +GS_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_BATCHER_ADDRESS +GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_PROPOSER_ADDRESS +GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_SEQUENCER_ADDRESS +GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY +IMPL_SALT +L1_RPC_KIND +L1_RPC_URL +PRIVATE_KEY +TENDERLY_PROJECT +TENDERLY_USERNAME
```

**If you don't see this output, you likely haven't [properly configured `direnv`](#configuring-direnv).**
Make sure you've configured `direnv` properly and run `direnv allow` again so that you see the desired output.

</Steps>

## Configure your network

Once you've built both repositories, you'll need to head back to the Optimism Monorepo to set up the configuration file for your chain.
Currently, chain configuration lives inside of the [`contracts-bedrock`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock) package in the form of a JSON file.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Move into the contracts-bedrock package</h3>}

```bash
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
```

{<h3>Install Foundry dependencies</h3>}

```bash
forge install
```

{<h3>Generate the configuration file</h3>}

Run the following script to generate the `getting-started.json` configuration file inside of the `deploy-config` directory.

```bash
./scripts/getting-started/config.sh
```

{<h3>Review the configuration file (Optional)</h3>}

If you'd like, you can review the configuration file that was just generated by opening up `deploy-config/getting-started.json` in your favorite text editor.
It's recommended to keep this file as-is for now so you don't run into any unexpected errors.

</Steps>

## Deploy the Create2 factory (optional)

If you're deploying an OP Stack chain to a network other than Sepolia, you may need to deploy a Create2 factory contract to the L1 chain.
This factory contract is used to deploy OP Stack smart contracts in a deterministic fashion.

<Callout>
This step is typically only necessary if you are deploying your OP Stack chain to custom L1 chain.
If you are deploying your OP Stack chain to Sepolia, you can safely skip this step.
</Callout>

<Steps>

{<h3>Check if the factory exists</h3>}

The Create2 factory contract will be deployed at the address `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`.
You can check if this contract has already been deployed to your L1 network with a block explorer or by running the following command:

```bash
cast codesize 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

If the command returns `0` then the contract has not been deployed yet.
If the command returns `69` then the contract has been deployed and you can safely skip this section.

{<h3>Fund the factory deployer</h3>}

You will need to send some ETH to the address that will be used to deploy the factory contract, `0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362`.
This address can only be used to deploy the factory contract and will not be used for anything else.
Send at least 1 ETH to this address on your L1 chain.

{<h3>Deploy the factory</h3>}

Using `cast`, deploy the factory contract to your L1 chain:

```bash
cast publish --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL 0xf8a58085174876e800830186a08080b853604580600e600039806000f350fe7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf31ba02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222a02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222 
```

{<h3>Wait for the transaction to be mined</h3>}

Make sure that the transaction is included in a block on your L1 chain before continuing.

{<h3>Verify that the factory was deployed</h3>}

Run the code size check again to make sure that the factory was properly deployed:

```bash
cast codesize 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

</Steps>

## Deploy the L1 contracts

Once you've configured your network, it's time to deploy the L1 contracts necessary for the functionality of the chain.

## Using `op-deployer`

The `op-deployer` tool simplifies the creation of genesis and rollup configuration files (`genesis.json` and `rollup.json`).
These files are crucial for initializing the execution client (`op-geth`) and consensus client (`op-node`) for your network.

The recommended flow for creating a genesis file and rollup configuration file on the OP Stack is as follows:


1.  **Deploy the L1 contracts** using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer).
2.  **Generate** both the L2 genesis file (`genesis.json`) and the rollup configuration file (`rollup.json`) using op-deployer's `inspect` commands.
3.  **Initialize** your off-chain components (e.g., execution client, consensus client).

<Callout type="info">
Using op-deployer for chain initialization is a requirement for all chains intending to be for chains who intend to be standard and join the superchain.
This ensures standardization and compatibility across the OP Stack ecosystem.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

1.  You have installed the `op-deployer` binary following the instructions in [deployer docs](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation).
    After installation, extract the `op-deployer` into your `PATH` and `cd op-deployer`.

2.  You have created and customized an intent file in a `.deployer` directory, typically by running:

    ```bash
    ./bin/op-deployer init --l1-chain-id <YOUR_L1_CHAIN_ID> --l2-chain-ids <YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID> --workdir .deployer
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_L1_CHAIN_ID>` and `<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>` with their respective values, see a list of [`chainIds`](https://chainid.network/).

3.  You have edited that intent file to your liking (roles, addresses, etc.).

### Step 1: Deploy the L1 contracts

To deploy your chain to L1, run:

```bash
./bin/op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer \
  --l1-rpc-url <RPC_URL_FOR_L1> \
  --private-key <DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX>
```

*   Replace `<RPC_URL_FOR_L1>` with the L1 RPC URL.
*   Replace `<DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX>` with the private key of the account used for deployment.

This command:

*   Reads your intent file in `.deployer/.`
*   Deploys the OP Stack contracts to the specified L1.
*   Updates a local `state.json` file with the results of the deployment.

### Step 2: Generate your L2 genesis file and rollup file

After your L1 contracts have been deployed, generate the L2 genesis and rollup configuration files by inspecting the deployer's `state.json.`

```bash
./bin/op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/genesis.json
./bin/op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <L2_CHAIN_ID> > .deployer/rollup.json
```

*   genesis.json is the file you will provide to your execution client (e.g. op-geth).
*   rollup.json is the file you will provide to your consensus client (e.g. op-node).

### Step 3: Initialize your off-chain components

Once you have `genesis.json` and `rollup.json`:

1.  Initialize op-geth using genesis.json.
2.  Configure op-node with rollup.json.
3.  Set up additional off-chain infrastructure as needed (block explorer, indexers, etc.). For more on architecture, see [Architecture overview](/operators/chain-operators/architecture).

## Initialize `op-geth`

You're almost ready to run your chain!
Now you just need to run a few commands to initialize `op-geth`.
You're going to be running a Sequencer node, so you'll need to import the `Sequencer` private key that you generated earlier.
This private key is what your Sequencer will use to sign new blocks.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the op-geth directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/op-geth
```

{<h3>Create a data directory folder</h3>}

```bash
mkdir datadir
```

{<h3>Build the op-geth binary</h3>}

```bash
make geth
```

{<h3>Initialize op-geth</h3>}

```bash
build/bin/geth init --state.scheme=hash --datadir=datadir genesis.json
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-geth`

Now you'll start `op-geth`, your Execution Client.
Note that you won't start seeing any transactions until you start the Consensus Client in the next step.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run `op-geth` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-geth directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/op-geth
```

{<h3>Run op-geth</h3>}

<Callout type="info">
You're using `--gcmode=archive` to run `op-geth` here because this node will act as your Sequencer.
It's useful to run the Sequencer in archive mode because the `op-proposer` requires access to the full state.
Feel free to run other (non-Sequencer) nodes in full mode if you'd like to save disk space. Just make sure at least one other archive node exists and the `op-proposer` points to it.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
It's important that you've already initialized the geth node at this point as per the previous section. Failure to do this will cause startup issues between `op-geth` and `op-node`.
</Callout>

```bash
./build/bin/geth \
  --datadir ./datadir \
  --http \
  --http.corsdomain="*" \
  --http.vhosts="*" \
  --http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --http.api=web3,debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --ws \
  --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --ws.port=8546 \
  --ws.origins="*" \
  --ws.api=debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --syncmode=full \
  --gcmode=archive \
  --nodiscover \
  --maxpeers=0 \
  --networkid=42069 \
  --authrpc.vhosts="*" \
  --authrpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --authrpc.port=8551 \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-node`

Once you've got `op-geth` running you'll need to run `op-node`.
Like Ethereum, the OP Stack has a Consensus Client (`op-node`) and an Execution Client (`op-geth`).
The Consensus Client "drives" the Execution Client over the Engine API.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-node` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-node directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-node
```

{<h3>Run op-node</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-node \
  --l2=http://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --sequencer.enabled \
  --sequencer.l1-confs=5 \
  --verifier.l1-confs=4 \
  --rollup.config=./rollup.json \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --p2p.disable \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --p2p.sequencer.key=$GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND
```

Once you run this command, you should start seeing the `op-node` begin to sync L2 blocks from the L1 chain.
Once the `op-node` has caught up to the tip of the L1 chain, it'll begin to send blocks to `op-geth` for execution.
At that point, you'll start to see blocks being created inside of `op-geth`.

<Callout type="info">
**By default, your `op-node` will try to use a peer-to-peer to speed up the synchronization process.**
If you're using a chain ID that is also being used by others, like the default chain ID for this tutorial (42069), your `op-node` will receive blocks signed by other sequencers.
These requests will fail and waste time and network resources.
**To avoid this, this tutorial starts with peer-to-peer synchronization disabled (`--p2p.disable`).**

Once you have multiple nodes, you may want to enable peer-to-peer synchronization.
You can add the following options to the `op-node` command to enable peer-to-peer synchronization with specific nodes:

```
  --p2p.static=<nodes> \
  --p2p.listen.ip=0.0.0.0 \
  --p2p.listen.tcp=9003 \
  --p2p.listen.udp=9003 \
```

You can alternatively also remove the [--p2p.static](/operators/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config#p2pstatic) option, but you may see failed requests from other chains using the same chain ID.
</Callout>

## Start `op-batcher`

The `op-batcher` takes transactions from the Sequencer and publishes those transactions to L1.
Once these Sequencer transactions are included in a finalized L1 block, they're officially part of the canonical chain.
The `op-batcher` is critical!

It's best to give the `Batcher` address at least 1 Sepolia ETH to ensure that it can continue operating without running out of ETH for gas.
Keep an eye on the balance of the `Batcher` address because it can expend ETH quickly if there are a lot of transactions to publish.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-batcher` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-batcher directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-batcher
```

{<h3>Run op-batcher</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-batcher \
  --l2-eth-rpc=http://localhost:8545 \
  --rollup-rpc=http://localhost:9545 \
  --poll-interval=1s \
  --sub-safety-margin=6 \
  --num-confirmations=1 \
  --safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=3 \
  --resubmission-timeout=30s \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=8548 \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --max-channel-duration=25 \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

<Callout type="info">
The [`--max-channel-duration=n`](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/batcher#set-your--op_batcher_max_channel_duration) setting tells the batcher to write all the data to L1 every `n` L1 blocks.
When it is low, transactions are written to L1 frequently and other nodes can synchronize from L1 quickly.
When it is high, transactions are written to L1 less frequently and the batcher spends less ETH.
If you want to reduce costs, either set this value to 0 to disable it or increase it to a higher value.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Start `op-proposer`

Now start `op-proposer`, which proposes new state roots.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-proposer` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-proposer directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-proposer
```

{<h3>Run op-proposer</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-proposer \
  --poll-interval=12s \
  --rpc.port=8560 \
  --rollup-rpc=http://localhost:9545 \
  --l2oo-address=$(cat ../packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/getting-started/.deploy | jq -r .L2OutputOracleProxy) \
  --private-key=$GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL
```

</Steps>

## Connect your wallet to your chain

You now have a fully functioning OP Stack Rollup with a Sequencer node running on `http://localhost:8545`.
You can connect your wallet to this chain the same way you'd connect your wallet to any other EVM chain.
If you need an easy way to connect to your chain, just [click here](https://chainid.link?network=opstack-getting-started).

## Get ETH on your chain

Once you've connected your wallet, you'll probably notice that you don't have any ETH to pay for gas on your chain.
The easiest way to deposit Sepolia ETH into your chain is to send ETH directly to the `L1StandardBridge` contract.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the contracts-bedrock directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock
```

{<h3>Get the address of the L1StandardBridgeProxy contract</h3>}

```bash
cat deployments/getting-started/.deploy | jq -r .L1StandardBridgeProxy
```

{<h3>Send some Sepolia ETH to the L1StandardBridgeProxy contract</h3>}

Grab the L1 bridge proxy contract address and, using the wallet that you want to have ETH on your Rollup, send that address a small amount of ETH on Sepolia (0.1 or less is fine).
This will trigger a deposit that will mint ETH into your wallet on L2.
It may take up to 5 minutes for that ETH to appear in your wallet on L2.

</Steps>

## See your rollup in action

You can interact with your Rollup the same way you'd interact with any other EVM chain.
Send some transactions, deploy some contracts, and see what happens!
