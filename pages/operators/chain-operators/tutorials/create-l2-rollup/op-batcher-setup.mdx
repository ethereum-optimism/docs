# Spin up batcher

After you have spun up your sequencer, you need to configure a batcher to submit L2 transaction batches to L1. The batcher is a critical component that ensures L2 transaction data is available on L1 for data availability and enables users to reconstruct the L2 state.

<Callout type="info">
  **Step 3 of 5**: This tutorial is designed to be followed step-by-step. Each step builds on the previous one.
</Callout>


## Understanding the batcher's role

The batcher (`op-batcher`) serves as a crucial component that bridges your L2 chain data to L1. Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **Batch submission**: Collecting L2 transactions and submitting them as batches to L1
*   **Data availability**: Ensuring L2 transaction data is available on L1 for verification
*   **Cost optimization**: Compressing and efficiently packing transaction data to minimize L1 costs
*   **Channel management**: Managing data channels for optimal batch submission timing

The batcher reads transaction data from your sequencer and submits compressed batches to the `BatchInbox` contract on L1.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your batcher, ensure you have:

**Running infrastructure:**

*   An operational sequencer node
*   Access to a L1 RPC endpoint

**Network information:**

*   Your L2 chain ID and network configuration
*   L1 network details (chain ID, RPC endpoints)
*   `BatchInbox` contract address from your deployment

## Software installation

### Finding the current stable releases

To ensure you're using the latest compatible versions of OP Stack components, always check the official [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases).

Look for the latest `op-batcher/v*` release that's compatible with your sequencer setup.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide uses `op-batcher/v1.13.2` which is compatible with op-node/v1.13.3 and op-geth/v1.101511.1 from the sequencer setup.
  Always check the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases) for compatibility information.
</Callout>

For setting up the batcher, we recommend building from source as it provides better control and helps with debugging. Docker alternative is also provided.

<Tabs items={['Build from source', 'Using Docker']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Building from source gives you full control over the binaries and is the preferred approach for this guide.

    <Steps>
      ### Clone and build op-batcher

      ```bash
      # If you don't already have the optimism repository from the sequencer setup
      git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
      cd optimism

      # Checkout the latest release tag
      git checkout op-batcher/v1.13.2

      # Build op-batcher
      cd op-batcher
      just

      # Binary will be available at ./bin/op-batcher
      ```

      ### Verify installation

      Run this command to verify the installation:

      ```bash
      ./bin/op-batcher --version
      ```
    </Steps>
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    If you prefer containerized deployment, you can use the official Docker images and do the following:

    <Steps>
      ### Set up directory structure and copy configuration files

      ```bash
      # Create your batcher working directory
      mkdir ~/batcher-node
      cd ~/batcher-node

      # Copy configuration files from op-deployer output
      # Note: Adjust the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
      cp ~/.deployer/state.json .

      # Extract the BatchInbox address
      BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].systemConfigProxyAddress')
      echo "BatchInbox Address: $BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS"
      ```

      ### Create environment variables file

      ```bash
      # Create .env file with your actual values
      cat > .env << 'EOF'
      # L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URLs
      L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

      # L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
      L2_RPC_URL=http://sequencer-node:8545
      ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://sequencer-node:8547

      # Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
      BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS

      # Private key - Replace with your actual private key
      BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

      # Batcher configuration
      POLL_INTERVAL=1s
      SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN=6
      NUM_CONFIRMATIONS=1
      SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT=3
      RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=30s
      MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION=25

      # RPC configuration
      BATCHER_RPC_PORT=8548
      EOF
      ```

      **Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values.

      ### Create a docker-compose.yml file

      <Callout type="info">
        This configuration assumes your sequencer is running in a Docker container named `sequencer-node` on the same `op-stack` network.
        Make sure your sequencer is running before starting the batcher.
      </Callout>

      ```yaml
      version: '3.8'

      services:
        op-batcher:
          image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-batcher:v1.13.2
          volumes:
            - .:/workspace
          working_dir: /workspace
          ports:
            - "8548:8548"
          env_file:
            - .env
          command:
            - "op-batcher"
            - "--l2-eth-rpc=${L2_RPC_URL}"
            - "--rollup-rpc=${ROLLUP_RPC_URL}"
            - "--poll-interval=${POLL_INTERVAL}"
            - "--sub-safety-margin=${SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN}"
            - "--num-confirmations=${NUM_CONFIRMATIONS}"
            - "--safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=${SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT}"
            - "--resubmission-timeout=${RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT}"
            - "--rpc.addr=0.0.0.0"
            - "--rpc.port=${BATCHER_RPC_PORT}"
            - "--rpc.enable-admin"
            - "--max-channel-duration=${MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION}"
            - "--l1-eth-rpc=${L1_RPC_URL}"
            - "--private-key=${BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY}"
            - "--batch-type=1"
            - "--data-availability-type=blobs"
            - "--log.level=info"
          restart: unless-stopped
      ```

      ### Start the batcher service

      ```bash
      # Make sure your sequencer network exists
      # Start the batcher
      docker-compose up -d

      # View logs
      docker-compose logs -f op-batcher
      ```

      ### Verify batcher is running

      ```bash
      # Check batcher RPC is responding
      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[],"id":1}' \
        http://localhost:8548

      # Check container status
      docker-compose ps
      ```

      ### Final directory structure

      ```bash
      ~/batcher-node/
      ├── state.json             # Copied from ~/.deployer/
      ├── .env                   # Environment variables
      └── docker-compose.yml     # Docker configuration
      ```
    </Steps>

    Your batcher is now operational and will continuously submit L2 transaction batches to L1!
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration setup

<Callout type="warning">
  The rest of this guide assumes you're using the **build-from-source** approach.
  If you chose Docker, all the necessary configuration was covered in the Docker tab above.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Organize your workspace

  Create your batcher working directory:

  ```bash
  # Create batcher directory at the same level as your sequencer
  mkdir batcher-node
  cd batcher-node

  # Create scripts directory
  mkdir scripts
  ```

  Your final directory structure should look like:

  ```bash
  ~/
  ├── optimism/               # Contains op-batcher binary
  ├── sequencer-node/         # Your sequencer setup
  ├── proposer-node/          # Your proposer setup
  ├── .deployer/             # From op-deployer
  │   └── state.json
  └── batcher-node/          # Your batcher working directory
      ├── state.json         # Copied from .deployer
      ├── .env
      └── scripts/
          └── start-batcher.sh
  ```

  ### Extract BatchInbox address

  Extract the `BatchInbox` contract address from your op-deployer output:

  ```bash
  # Navigate to batcher directory
  cd ~/batcher-node

  # Copy the deployment state file from op-deployer
  # Update the path if your .deployer directory is located elsewhere
  cp ../.deployer/state.json .

  # Extract the BatchInbox address
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=$(cat state.json | jq -r '.opChainDeployments[0].systemConfigProxyAddress')
  echo "BatchInbox Address: $BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS"
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    The batcher submits transaction batches to the `BatchInbox` contract on L1. This contract is responsible for accepting and storing L2 transaction data.
  </Callout>

  ### Set up environment variables

  Create your `.env` file with the actual values:

  ```bash
  # Create .env file with your actual values
  # L1 Configuration - Replace with your actual RPC URL
  L1_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ACTUAL_INFURA_KEY

  # L2 Configuration - Should match your sequencer setup
  L2_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
  ROLLUP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547

  # Contract addresses - Extract from your op-deployer output
  BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=YOUR_ACTUAL_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS

  # Private key - Replace with your actual private key
  BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY

  # Batcher configuration
  POLL_INTERVAL=1s
  SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN=6
  NUM_CONFIRMATIONS=1
  SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT=3
  RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=30s
  MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION=25

  # RPC configuration
  BATCHER_RPC_PORT=8548
  ```

  **Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values (`YOUR_ACTUAL_*`) with your real configuration values!

  ### Get your private key

  Get a private key from your wallet that will be used for submitting batches to L1. This account needs sufficient ETH to pay for L1 gas costs.

  <Callout type="warning">
    The batcher account needs to be funded with ETH on L1 to pay for batch submission transactions. Monitor this account's balance regularly as it will consume ETH for each batch submission.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

## Batcher configuration

Create `scripts/start-batcher.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source .env

# Path to the op-batcher binary we built
../optimism/op-batcher/bin/op-batcher \
  --l2-eth-rpc=$L2_RPC_URL \
  --rollup-rpc=$ROLLUP_RPC_URL \
  --poll-interval=$POLL_INTERVAL \
  --sub-safety-margin=$SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN \
  --num-confirmations=$NUM_CONFIRMATIONS \
  --safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=$SAFE_ABORT_NONCE_TOO_LOW_COUNT \
  --resubmission-timeout=$RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=$BATCHER_RPC_PORT \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --max-channel-duration=$MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --batch-type=1 \
  --data-availability-type=blobs \
  --log.level=info
```

### Batcher parameters explained

*   **`--poll-interval`**: How frequently the batcher checks for new L2 blocks to batch
*   **`--sub-safety-margin`**: Number of confirmations to wait before considering L1 transactions safe
*   **`--max-channel-duration`**: Maximum time (in L1 blocks) to keep a channel open
*   **`--batch-type`**: Type of batch encoding (1 for span batches, 0 for singular batches)
*   **`--data-availability-type`**: Whether to use blobs or calldata for data availability

## Starting the batcher

<Steps>
  ### Verify prerequisites

  Ensure your sequencer and rollup node are running:

  ```bash
  # Test L1 connectivity
  # Note: Make sure you have exported these environment variables to your current shell session:
  # export L1_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY"
  # export L2_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545"  
  # export ROLLUP_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8547"

  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $L1_RPC_URL

  # Test L2 connectivity
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $L2_RPC_URL

  # Test rollup node connectivity
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' \
    $ROLLUP_RPC_URL
  ```

  ### Start the batcher

  ```bash
  # Make the script executable
  chmod +x scripts/start-batcher.sh

  # Start the batcher
  ./scripts/start-batcher.sh
  ```
</Steps>

## Verification

<Steps>
  ### Check batcher status

  Verify your batcher is working correctly:

  ```bash
  # Check batcher RPC is responding
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_startBatcher","params":[],"id":1}' \
    http://localhost:8548
  ```

  ### Monitor batch submission activity

  ```bash
  # Monitor batch submission activity (check L1 for recent transactions from your batcher address)
  # Replace with your actual batcher address
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionCount","params":["0xYOUR_BATCHER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' \
    $L1_RPC_URL

  # Check if your batcher address has enough ETH for gas
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xYOUR_BATCHER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' \
    $L1_RPC_URL
  ```
