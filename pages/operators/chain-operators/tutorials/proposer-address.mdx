# Managing the proposer address

This guide explains how to update the proposer address, within the dispute game smart contracts, for chains using permissioned fault proofs.
The [proposer](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/architecture#permissioned-components) is responsible for submitting L2 outputs to L1, which is a critical component of the OP Stack.
You will need the [L1ProxyAdmin](/superchain/privileged-roles#l1-proxy-admin) account, before you begin.

The proposer role is defined in the [`PermissionedDisputeGame.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol) contract for chains running permissioned fault proofs.
When you need to change the proposer address, you must update the implementation for `gametype 1` in the `DisputeGameFactory.sol` contract.

## Steps to update the proposer address

1.  **Identify the current configuration**

    First, confirm that your chain is using permissioned fault proofs by checking the `DisputeGameFactory` contract on your L1. You can verify the current implementation by querying the `gameImpls` mapping with the permissioned cannon game type. This will return the current implementation contract for permissioned fault proof games.

    See the [DisputeGameFactory contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol) for the `gameImpls` function details.

2.  **Prepare the new implementation**

    You'll need to deploy a new implementation of the `PermissionedDisputeGame.sol` contract with the updated proposer address. When deploying:

    *   The constructor requires multiple parameters including the _new_ proposer address
    *   Use the same parameters as your existing implementation, except for the new proposer address
    *   Ensure all inherited contracts are properly initialized
    *   Test deployment on a testnet first

    For constructor parameters, refer to the [PermissionedDisputeGame contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol).

3.  **Update the implementation in the DisputeGameFactory**

    Using the L1ProxyAdmin account, call the `setImplementation()` function to update the permissioned game type:

    *   `_gameType`: Use `GameType.PERMISSIONED_CANNON` (value: 1) for permissioned fault proof games
    *   `_impl`: The address of your new implementation with the updated proposer

    Only the owner of the DisputeGameFactory contract (typically the ProxyAdmin) can call this function. See the [DisputeGameFactory contract source](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol) for the function signature.

4.  **Verify the update**

    After updating the implementation, verify the change was successful by:

    a. Checking the implementation address is updated in the `gameImpls` mapping

    b. Creating a new dispute game to confirm the proposer address:

    b. Creating a new dispute game to confirm the proposer address:
       1. Call `create()` on the DisputeGameFactory with the permissioned cannon game type.
       2. Query the `PROPOSER()` function on the newly created game.
       3. Verify it matches the new address.

*   This operation should be planned carefully as the proposer is a critical component of your rollup.
*   Ensure the new proposer address is valid and properly controlled before making the change.
*   Consider testing the procedure on a testnet before applying to production environments.
*   The `L1ProxyAdmin` is a highly privileged role - ensure proper access controls are in place.
*   All existing dispute games will continue to use the old proposer address, but newly created games will use the updated proposer.
*   The proposer must have sufficient ETH balance to post bonds and pay for gas when creating new dispute games.

## Next steps

*   After updating the proposer address, you may need to configure the new proposer node. See the [proposer configuration](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/proposer) for details.

*   Read the [protocol configurability specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html#proposer-address) for more in-depth details.
