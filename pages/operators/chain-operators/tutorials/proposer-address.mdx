# Managing the proposer address

This guide explains how to update the proposer address for chains using permissioned fault proofs.
The proposer is responsible for submitting L2 outputs to L1, which is a critical component of the OP Stack.
You will need the [L1ProxyAdmin](/superchain/privileged-roles#l1-proxy-admin) account, before you begin.

The proposer role is defined in the [`PermissionedDisputeGame.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol) contract for chains running permissioned fault proofs.
When you need to change the proposer address, you must update the implementation for `gametype 1` in the `DisputeGameFactory.sol` contract.

## Steps to update the proposer address

1.  **Identify the current configuration**

    First, confirm that your chain is using permissioned fault proofs by checking the `DisputeGameFactory` contract on your L1. You can verify the current implementation by querying the `gameImpls` mapping with the permissioned cannon game type. This will return the current implementation contract for permissioned fault proof games.

    See the [DisputeGameFactory contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol) for the `gameImpls` function details.

2.  **Prepare the new implementation**

    You'll need to deploy a new implementation of the `PermissionedDisputeGame.sol` contract with the updated proposer address. When deploying:

    *   The constructor requires multiple parameters including the proposer address
    *   Use the same parameters as your existing implementation, except for the new proposer address
    *   Ensure all inherited contracts are properly initialized
    *   Test deployment on a testnet first

    For constructor parameters, refer to the [PermissionedDisputeGame contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/PermissionedDisputeGame.sol).

3.  **Update the implementation in the DisputeGameFactory**

    Using the L1ProxyAdmin account, call the `setImplementation()` function to update the permissioned game type:

    *   `_gameType`: Use `GameType.PERMISSIONED_CANNON` (value: 1) for permissioned fault proof games
    *   `_impl`: The address of your new implementation with the updated proposer

    Only the owner of the DisputeGameFactory contract (typically the ProxyAdmin) can call this function. See the [DisputeGameFactory contract source](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol) for the function signature.

4.  **Verify the update**

    After updating the implementation, verify the change was successful by:

    a. Checking the implementation address is updated in the `gameImpls` mapping

    b. Creating a new dispute game to confirm the proposer address:

    *   Call `create()` on the DisputeGameFactory with the permissioned cannon game type
    *   Query the `PROPOSER()` function on the newly created game
    *   Verify it matches your new address

    For verification methods, see the [DisputeGameFactory documentation](https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/stage-one/dispute-game-factory.html) and [game interface specs](https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/game-interface.html).

## Important considerations

*   This operation should be planned carefully as the proposer is a critical component of your rollup.
*   Ensure the new proposer address is valid and properly controlled before making the change.
*   Consider testing the procedure on a testnet before applying to production environments.
*   The `L1ProxyAdmin` is a highly privileged role - ensure proper access controls are in place.
*   All existing dispute games will continue to use the old proposer address, but newly created games will use the updated proposer.
*   The proposer must have sufficient ETH balance to post bonds when creating new dispute games.

## Next steps

*   After updating the proposer address, you may need to configure the new proposer node. See the [proposer configuration](/operators/chain-operators/configuration/proposer) for details.

*   Read the [protocol configurability specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html#proposer-address) for more in-depth details.
