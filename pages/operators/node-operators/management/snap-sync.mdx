# Using snap sync for node operators

This guide reviews the optional feature of Snap Sync for node operators, including benefits and how to enable the feature.

Snap Sync significantly improves the experience of syncing an OP Stack node. Snap Sync is a native feature of go-ethereum that is now optionally enabled on `op-node` & `op-geth`.
Snap Sync works by downloading a snapshot of the state from other nodes on the network and is then able to start executing blocks from the completed state rather than having to re-execute every single block.
This means that performing a Snap Sync is significantly faster than performing a full sync.

*   For OP Mainnet, node operators will be able to sync without having to download the [bedrock datadir](snapshots).
*   This also enables nodes to join the network after Ecotone activates without requiring a [blob archiver](blobs).
*   Archive nodes are also fully supported.

## Enable snap sync for your node

<Callout type="warning">
For snap sync, all `op-geth` nodes should expose port `30303` TCP and `30303` UDP to easily find other op-geth nodes to sync from. 
  *   If you set the port with [`--discovery.port`](/operators/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#discoveryport), then you must open the port specified for UDP. 
  *   If you set [`--port`](/operators/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#port), then you must open the port specified for TCP.
  *   The only exception is for sequencers and transaction ingress nodes.
</Callout>

Choose one of the following options to enable snap sync:

*   **Option 1:** Snap sync, no required datadir on OP Mainnet. This is the recommended option because `op-node` tells `op-geth` to snap sync and then `op-geth` downloads the state at tip and once complete switches to inserting blocks one by one.

<Tabs items={['op-node', 'op-geth']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=execution-layer (not default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=snap (default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

*   **Option 2:** Archive sync with required [datadir](snapshots) for OP Mainnet, but no required datadir for other OP Stack networks.
    This option is faster for archive nodes than other options because `--syncmode=full` means `op-geth` executes every block in the chain.

<Tabs items={['op-node', 'op-geth']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=execution-layer (not default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=full (not default)
    --gcmode=archive (not default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

*   **Option 3:** Continue using current sync approach (before Ecotone) where `op-node` reads from L1 and inserts blocks into `op-geth`.
    This option might be preferred for decentralized developer groups who need to confirm everything on the chain.

<Tabs items={['op-node', 'op-geth']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=consensus-layer (default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    --syncmode=full (not default)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Enabling execution layer sync for alternative clients
In addition to op-geth, you can enable execution-layer syncing with alternative execution clients such as `reth` and `op-erigon`.

Unlike `op-geth`, `reth` and `op-erigon` are designed as archive nodes, which means they require the complete history of the chain. 
However, these clients can still retrieve block headers and data through the P2P network instead of deriving each individual block, resulting in a faster initial sync.

For OP Mainnet, the [bedrock datadir](snapshots) is required. For other OP Stack networks, no datadir is required. 

To enable execution layer sync for these clients, set the following flags on `op-node`:
```shell
# for reth
--syncmode=execution-layer (not default)
--l2.enginekind=reth (not default)

# for erigon
--syncmode=execution-layer (not default)
--l2.enginekind=erigon (not default)
```
