# Node Troubleshooting

This page lists common troubleshooting scenarios and solutions for node operators.

## 401 Unauthorized: Signature Invalid

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
WARN [12-13|15:53:20.263] Derivation process temporary error       attempts=80 err="stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: failed to fetch current L2 forkchoice state: failed to find the finalized L2 block: failed to determine L2BlockRef of finalized, could not get payload: 401 Unauthorized: signature is invalid
```

It means that the `op-node` is unable to authenticate with `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC using the JWT secret. 

### Solution

1.  Check that the JWT secret is correct in both services.
2.  Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

## 403 Forbidden: Invalid Host Specified

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"err":"403 Forbidden: invalid host specified\n","lvl":"error","msg":"error getting latest header","t":"2022-12-13T22:29:18.932833159Z"}
```

It means that you have not whitelisted `op-node`'s host with `op-geth`. 

### Solution

1.  Make sure that the `--authrpc.vhosts` parameter in `op-geth` is either set to the correct host, or `*`.
2.  Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

## Failed to Load P2P Config

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
CRIT [12-13|13:46:21.386] Application failed                       message="failed to load p2p config: failed to load p2p discovery options: failed to open discovery db: mkdir /p2p: permission denied"
```

It means that the `op-node` lacks write access to the P2P discovery or peerstore directories. 

### Solution

1.  Make sure that the `op-node` has write access to the P2P directory. By default, this is `/p2p`.
2.  Set the P2P directory to somewhere the `op-node` can access via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.
3.  Set the discovery path to `memory` to disable persistence via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.

## Wrong Chain

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"attempts":183,"err":"stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: wrong chain L1: genesis: 0x4104895a540d87127ff11eef0d51d8f63ce00a6fc211db751a45a4b3a61a9c83:8106656, got 0x12e2c18a3ac50f74d3dd3c0ed7cb751cc924c2985de3dfed44080e683954f1dd:8106656","lvl":"warn","msg":"Derivation process temporary error","t":"2022-12-13T23:31:37.855253213Z"}
```

It means that the `op-node` is pointing to the wrong chain. 

### Solution

1.  Verify that the `op-node`'s L1 URL is pointing to the correct L1 for the given network.
2.  Verify that the `op-node`'s rollup config/`--network` parameter is set to the correct network.
3.  Verify that the `op-node`'s L2 URL is pointing to the correct instance of `op-geth`, and that `op-geth` is properly initialized for the given network.

## Unclean Shutdowns

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-geth`:

```
WARN [03-05|16:18:11.238] Unclean shutdown detected                booted=2023-03-05T11:09:26+0000 age=5h8m45s
```

It means `op-geth` has experienced an unclean shutdown. The [geth docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/databases#unclean-shutdowns)
say if Geth stops unexpectedly, the database can be corrupted. This is known as an 
"unclean shutdown" and it can lead to a variety of problems for the node when 
it is restarted. 

It is always best to shut down Geth gracefully, i.e. using a 
shutdown command such as `ctrl-c`, `docker stop -t 300 <container ID>` or 
`systemctl stop` (although please note that `systemctl stop` has a default timeout 
of 90s - if Geth takes longer than this to gracefully shut down it will quit 
forcefully. Update the `TimeoutSecs` variable in `systemd.service` to override this 
value to something larger, at least 300s). 

This way, Geth knows to write all relevant information into the database to 
allow the node to restart properly later. This can involve >1GB of information 
being written to the LevelDB database which can take several minutes.

### Solution

If an unexpected shutdown does occur, the `removedb` subcommand can be used to 
delete the state database and resync it from the ancient database. This should 
get the database back up and running.
