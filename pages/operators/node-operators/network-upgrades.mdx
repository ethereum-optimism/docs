# Network upgrade overview

This page provides hardfork activation timestamps and links to detailed specifications.
The documentation outlines the hardfork release process.
The network upgrade naming scheme after the Bedrock upgrade follows a geology theme based on the next letter in the English alphabet.

## Activations

Network upgrades are activated by timestamps. Failing to upgrade your OP Stack software before the timestamp will cause a chain divergence and you will need to resync the chain. Optimistic activation times refer to times that are pending governance approval.

## Upgrade process

Network upgrades follow this general process in which the features included in
the upgrade are put into a release version cut from the `develop` branch and
then the software is deployed on production networks.

<Callout type="info">
  "Baking" on a network means the node software has been deployed and is live.
  Engineers take this time to observe the behavior of the software on
  production networks.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Devnet

  *   `Devnet Upgrade Notice Period` is for core developers to upgrade the
      node software on an internal devnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Devnet`
  *   `Baking on Devnet`

  ### Testnet

  *   `Testnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow testnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on testnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activates on Testnet`
  *   `Baking on Testnet`

  ### Mainnet

  *   `Governance Voting Review Period` is when the Optimism Collective's
      governance system reviews proposals, including network upgrade proposals.
  *   `Governance Voting Period` is when the Optimism Collective's governance
      system votes on proposals.
  *   `Veto Period` is when the Citizens' House of the governance system can
      veto a protocol upgrade that has been approved by the Token House.
  *   `Cut Mainnet Release`
  *   `Mainnet Upgrade Notice Period` is to allow mainnet node operators to
      upgrade the node software on mainnet prior to the activation timestamp.
  *   `Upgrade Activated`
</Steps>

## More information

*   To check for the latest node software, see the [Software Releases](/operators/node-operators/releases).
*   For more information on the governance process see the [governance documentation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).
