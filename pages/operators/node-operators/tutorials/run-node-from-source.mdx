# Running a Superchain node from source

This tutorial explains how to run an OP Stack node from source code for full nodes and archive nodes.
Running an OP Stack node from source code is a flexible alternative to using pre-built Docker images.

## Building the source code

You'll need to build `op-node` and `op-geth` from their respective source repositories before you can run a node.
Make sure to follow the instructions on [Building a Node from Source](./node-from-source) before continuing.

## Hardware requirements

Hardware requirements for OP Mainnet nodes can vary depending on the type of node you plan to run.
Archive nodes generally require significantly more resources than full nodes.
Below are suggested minimum hardware requirements for each type of node.

*   16GB RAM
*   Reasonably modern CPU

### SSD capacity requirements

Given the growing size of the blockchain state, choosing the right SSD size is important.
Below are the storage needs as of April 2024:

*   **Full Node:** The snapshot size for a full node is approximately 1.6TB, with the data directory's capacity increasing by about 1TB every six months.
*   **Archive Node:** The snapshot size for an archive node is approximately 5TB, with the data directory's capacity increasing by about 3TB every six months.

Based on these trends, node operators should plan for future storage needs and choose SSDs that can handle these increasing requirements.

<Callout type="info">
  Geth supports a "freezer" feature to store older chain data on HDDs, saving SSD space. Configure this for OP Mainnet using the `--datadir.ancient` flag. See [Geth docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/databases) and [OP docs](/operators/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#datadirancient) for details.
</Callout>

## Superchain nodes

All nodes in the Superchain ecosystem can be run from `op-node` and `op-geth` binaries if they're included in the [Superchain Registry](/superchain/superchain-registry). You can specify the type of node you want to run by configuring the `--network` flag on `op-node` and the `--op-network` flag on `op-geth`.

### Assess blob archiver

Assess if you need to configure a blob archiver service by reading the [Configure a Blob Archiver documentation](/operators/node-operators/management/blobs#configure-a-blob-archiver).

### Create a JWT secret

`op-geth` and `op-node` communicate over the engine API authrpc.
This communication is secured using a shared secret.
You will need to generate a shared secret and provide it to both `op-geth` and `op-node` when you start them.
In this case, the secret takes the form of a 32 byte hex string.

Run the following command to generate a random 32 byte hex string:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

### Start `op-geth`

It's generally easier to start `op-geth` before starting `op-node`.
You can still start `op-geth` without yet running `op-node`, but the `op-geth` instance will simply not receive any blocks until `op-node` is started.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Navigate to your op-geth directory</h3>}

  Find the directory where you built the `op-geth` binary.

  {<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

  Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-geth` directory.

  ```bash
  cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
  ```

  {<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

  Set the following environment variables:

  ```bash
  export DATADIR_PATH=... # Path to the desired data directory for op-geth
  ```

  {<h3>Start op-geth</h3>}

  <Callout type="info">
    If you want to run an archive node, you will need to set `--gcmode=archive`. If you want to run an OP Mainnet archive node, please refer to the [OP Mainnet archive nodes](#op-mainnet-archive-nodes) section.
  </Callout>
  Use the following command to start `op-geth` in a default configuration.
  The JSON-RPC API will become available on port 8545.
  Refer to the `op-geth` [configuration documentation](/operators/node-operators/configuration/execution-config) for more detailed information about available options.

  ```bash
  ./build/bin/geth \
    --http \
    --http.port=8545 \
    --http.addr=localhost \
    --authrpc.addr=localhost \
    --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
    --verbosity=3 \
    --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://mainnet-sequencer.optimism.io/ \
    --op-network=op-sepolia \
    --datadir=$DATADIR_PATH
  ```
</Steps>

### Start `op-node`

Once you've started `op-geth`, you can start `op-node`.
`op-node` will connect to `op-geth` and begin synchronizing the OP Mainnet state.
`op-node` will begin sending block payloads to `op-geth` when it derives enough blocks from Ethereum.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Navigate to your op-node directory</h3>}

  Find the directory where you built the `op-node` binary.

  {<h3>Copy in the JWT secret</h3>}

  Both `op-geth` and `op-node` need to use the same JWT secret.
  Copy the JWT secret you generated in a previous step into the `op-node` directory.

  ```bash
  cp /path/to/jwt.txt .
  ```

  {<h3>Set environment variables</h3>}

  Set the following environment variables:

  ```bash
  export L1_RPC_URL=...  # URL for the L1 node to sync from. If your L1 RPC is a local node, the most common URL is http://127.0.0.1:8545
  export L1_RPC_KIND=... # RPC type (alchemy, quicknode, infura, parity, nethermind, debug_geth, erigon, basic, any)
  export L1_BEACON_URL=... # URL address for the L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use. If your L1 Beacon is a local node, the most common URL is http://127.0.0.1:3500
  ```

  {<h3>Start op-node</h3>}

  Use the following command to start `op-node` in a default configuration.
  Refer to the `op-node` [configuration documentation](/operators/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config) for more detailed information about available options.

  <Callout type="warning">
    The `op-node` RPC should not be exposed publicly. If left exposed, it could
    accidentally expose admin controls to the public internet.
  </Callout>

  <Callout type="info">
  Sync mode is set to `--syncmode=execution-layer` to enable [snap sync](/operators/node-operators/management/snap-sync)
  and remove the need to initialize the node with a data directory.
  </Callout>

  ```bash
  ./bin/op-node \
    --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
    --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
    --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
    --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
    --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
    --network=op-sepolia \
    --syncmode=execution-layer \
    --l2.enginekind=geth
  ```

  <Callout>
    Some L1 nodes, like Erigon, do not support the `eth_getProof` RPC method that the `op-node` uses to load L1 data for certain processing steps.
    If you are using an L1 node that does not support `eth_getProof`, you will need to include the `--l1.trustrpc` flag when starting `op-node`.
    Note that this flag will cause `op-node` to trust the L1 node to provide correct data as it will no longer be able to independently verify the data it receives.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

### Synchronization verification

Once you've started `op-geth` and `op-node` you should see the two begin to 
communicate with each other and synchronize the OP Mainnet chain.

#### Snap sync (default)

Initial synchronization can take several hours to complete. You will see these 
`op-node` logs at the start of snap sync:

```text
INFO [03-06|10:56:55.602] Starting EL sync
INFO [03-06|10:56:55.615] Sync progress                            reason="unsafe payload from sequencer while in EL sync" l2_finalized=000000..000000:0 l2_safe=000000..000000:0 l2_pending_safe=000000..000000:0 l2_unsafe=4284ab..7e7e84:117076319 l2_time=1,709,751,415 l1_derived=000000..000000:0
INFO [03-06|10:56:57.567] Optimistically inserting unsafe L2 execution payload to drive EL sync id=4ac160..df4d12:117076320
```

`Starting EL sync` is shown once and the **sync progress / inserting logs** should be repeated until done.

`op-node` will log the following when done:

```text
lvl=info msg="Finished EL sync" sync_duration=23h25m0.370558429s finalized_block=0x4f69e83ff1407f2e2882f2526ee8a154ac326590799889cede3af04a7742f18d:116817417
```

There are two stages on `op-geth` for snap sync:

<Steps>
  {<h3>Downloading the headers</h3>}
  `op-geth` log something like this as it is downloading the headers:

  ```text
  lvl=info msg="Syncing beacon headers" downloaded=116775778 left=1162878 eta=53.182s 
  ```

  {<h3>Sync progress</h3>}  

  For the second stage, `op-geth` will log the following:

  ```text
  lvl=info msg="Syncing: state download in progress" synced=99.75% state="191.33 GiB" accounts=124,983,227@25.62GiB slots=806,829,266@165.16GiB codes=78965@566.74MiB eta=-2m7.602s
  ```

  ```text
  msg="Syncing: chain download in progress" synced=100.00% chain="176.01 GiB" headers=116,817,399@45.82GiB bodies=116,817,286@52.87GiB receipts=116,817,286@77.32GiB eta=77.430ms
  ```
  
  All the while, `op-geth` will also log the forkchoice update:

  ```text
  Forkchoice requested sync to new head  number=117,076,468 hash=e3884c..bf4e2b
  ```

</Steps>

#### Full sync

<Callout type="info">
For OP Mainnet you will need access to the migrated database to run a full node with full sync.
You can [migrate your own data directory](https://web.archive.org/web/20240110231645/https://blog.oplabs.co/reproduce-bedrock-migration/) or follow the options available for [archive nodes](#get-the-migrated-data-directory).
</Callout>

Initial full synchronization can take several days or weeks to complete. During this time, you will initially observe `op-node` deriving blocks from Ethereum without sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
This means that `op-node` is requesting blocks from Ethereum one-by-one and determining the corresponding OP Mainnet blocks that were published to Ethereum.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|13:31:20.389] Advancing bq origin                      origin=17171d..1bc69b:8300332 originBehind=false
```

Once the `op-node` has derived enough blocks from Ethereum, it will begin sending these blocks to `op-geth`.
You should see logs like the following from `op-node`:

```text
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Sync progress                            reason="processed safe block derived from L1" l2_finalized=ef93e6..e0f367:4067805 l2_safe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_unsafe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_time=1,673,564,096 l1_derived=6079cd..be4231:8301091
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Found next batch                         epoch=8e8a03..11a6de:8301087 batch_epoch=8301087 batch_timestamp=1,673,564,098
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.461] generated attributes in payload queue    txs=1  timestamp=1,673,564,098
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.463] inserted block                           hash=e80dc4..72a759 number=4,068,015 state_root=660ced..043025 timestamp=1,673,564,098 parent=7fe3f6..900127 prev_randao=78e43d..36f07a fee_recipient=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011 txs=1  update_safe=true
```

You should then also begin to see logs like the following from `op-geth`:

```text
INFO [06-26|14:02:12.974] Imported new potential chain segment     number=4,068,194 hash=a334a0..609a83 blocks=1         txs=1         mgas=0.000  elapsed=1.482ms     mgasps=0.000   age=5mo2w20h dirty=2.31MiB

```

## OP Mainnet archive nodes

<Callout type="info">
  You only need an archive node if you need the historical state. Most node operators should default to full nodes.
</Callout>

### Get the migrated data directory

OP Mainnet underwent a large database migration as part of the [Bedrock Upgrade](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608050602/https://blog.oplabs.co/introducing-optimism-bedrock/) in 2023.
You will need access to the migrated OP Mainnet database to run an archive node.
You can [migrate your own data directory](https://web.archive.org/web/20240110231645/https://blog.oplabs.co/reproduce-bedrock-migration/) or simply download database that has already been migrated.
In this section, you'll learn how to download and verify the pre-migrated database.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Download the Migrated Data Directory</h3>}

  Click the link below to find the latest publicly available database snapshots for OP Mainnet.
  Snapshots are available for multiple dates and snapshots get larger as they get closer to the current date.
  Snapshots are large files and may take some time to download.
  [OP Mainnet Snapshots](/operators/node-operators/management/snapshots#op-mainnet)

  {<h3>Verify the Download</h3>}

  You should always verify the integrity of your downloads to ensure that they have not been corrupted.
  A corrupted database can include invalid data or may cause your node to fail.
  Verify the integrity of the download by checking the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded file.

  ```bash
  sha256sum <filename>
  ```

  For instance, if you've downloaded the very first database snapshot, you can verify the download by running the following command:

  ```bash
  sha256sum mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst
  ```

  You should see the following output:

  ```bash
  ec4baf47e309a14ffbd586dc85376833de640c0f2a8d7355cb8a9e64c38bfcd1  mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst
  ```

  Your exact output will depend on the snapshot you've downloaded.
  Check the [OP Mainnet Snapshots](/operators/node-operators/management/snapshots#op-mainnet) page for the correct checksum for the snapshot you've downloaded.

  {<h3>Extract the Data Directory</h3>}

  Once you've downloaded the database snapshot, you'll need to extract it to a directory on your machine.
  This will take some time to complete.

  ```bash
  tar xvf <filename>
  ```

  For instance, if you've downloaded the very first database snapshot, you can extract it by running the following command:

  ```bash
  tar xvf mainnet-bedrock.tar.zst
  ```

  {<h3>Configure op-geth for archive mode</h3>}

  Set `--syncmode=full` and `--gcmode=archive` on `op-geth`.
</Steps>

### Get the legacy Geth directory (optional)

Blocks and transactions included in OP Mainnet before the Bedrock Upgrade cannot be executed by modern OP Mainnet nodes.
OP Mainnet nodes will **serve** these blocks and transactions but cannot run certain queries against them (e.g. `eth_call`).
If you need to run stateful queries like `eth_call` against these older blocks and transactions, you will need to run a Legacy Geth node alongside your OP Mainnet node.

Running a Legacy Geth node is entirely optional and typically only useful for operators who want to run complete archive nodes of the OP Mainnet state.
If you want to run a full node then you can safely skip this section.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Download the Legacy Geth Data Directory</h3>}

  Click the link below to download the latest publicly available database snapshot for Legacy Geth.
  This is a very large file (2.9TB), so expect the download to take some time to complete.

  [Legacy Geth Data Directory (2.9TB)](/operators/node-operators/management/snapshots#op-mainnet-legacy)

  {<h3>Verify the Download</h3>}

  You should always verify the integrity of your downloads to ensure that they have not been corrupted.
  A corrupted database can include invalid data or may cause your node to fail.
  Verify the integrity of the download by checking the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded file.

  ```bash
  sha256sum mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst
  ```

  You should see the following output:

  ```bash
  4adedb61125b81b55f9bdccc2e85092050c65ef2253c86e2b79569732b772829  mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst
  ```

  If you see a different output, then the download is corrupted and you should try downloading the file again.

  {<h3>Extract the Data Directory</h3>}

  Once you've downloaded the database snapshot, you'll need to extract it to a directory on your machine.
  This will take some time to complete.

  ```bash
  tar xvf mainnet-legacy-archival.tar.zst
  ```
</Steps>

### Start legacy Geth (optional)

If you've chosen to run a Legacy Geth node alongside your OP Mainnet node, you'll need to start it before you start your OP Mainnet node.

<Steps>
  {<h3>Navigate to your Legacy Geth directory</h3>}

  Find the directory where you built the `l2geth` binary.

  {<h3>Start l2geth</h3>}

  Run the following command to start `l2geth`:

  ```bash
  USING_OVM=true \
    ETH1_SYNC_SERVICE_ENABLE=false \
    RPC_API=eth,rollup,net,web3,debug \
    RPC_ENABLE=true \
    RPC_PORT=8546 \
    ./build/bin/geth --datadir /path/to/l2geth-datadir
  ```
</Steps>
