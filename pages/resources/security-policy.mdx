# Security Policy and Bug Bounty Program

This page describes general best practices for reporting bugs and provides specific reporting guidelines for OP Stack and OP Mainnet code contained within the [ethereum-optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism) GitHub organization.

<Callout type="error">
  How NOT to disclose a vulnerability

  Do *not* disclose vulnerabilities publicly or by executing them against a production network. If you do, will you not only be putting users at risk, but you will forfeit your right to a reward. Always follow the appropriate reporting pathways as described below.

  *   Do *not* disclose the vulnerability publicly, for example by filing a public ticket.
  *   Do *not* test the vulnerability on a publicly available network, either the testnet or the mainnet.

## Optimism Bug Bounty Program

Optimism takes security seriously and as such, we have a massive bug bounty program. We don't just talk about it either! We have given out one of the [largest bounty payouts ever](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/disclosure-fixing-a-critical-bug-in-optimisms-geth-fork-a836ebdf7c94)! You can read more about that bug [here](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html). Below are the various bug bounty programs we have, as well as how to reach out to us if your bug is not covered by an existing bounty.

### Main Bounty Page

Optimism has a very detailed [Bug Bounty Page on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/). In the listing you can find all the information relating to assets in scope, reporting, and the payout process.

### Bedrock Audit Contest

With our upcoming launch of [Bedrock](/differences-op-stack) we have launched a [Sherlock audit contest](https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/38).

### Unscoped Bugs

If you think you have found a significant bug or vulnerabilities in OP Stack smart contracts, infrastructure, etc., even if that component is not covered by an existing bug bounty, please report it to via the [Optimism Mainnet Immunefi program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/). The impact of any and all reported issues will be considered and the program has previously rewarded security researchers for bugs not within its stated scope.

## Reporting Other Vulnerabilities

For vulnerabilities in any websites, email servers, or other non-critical infrastructure within the OP Stack, please email [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/) at [security@oplabs.co](mailto:security@oplabs.co) and include detailed instructions for confirming and reproducing the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Disclosure

Each OP Stack component maintainer may determine its own process for vulnerability disclosure. However, the following describes a recommended process for disclosure that is currently in use by [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/).

In the event that an OP Stack component maintainer learns of a critical security vulnerability, the maintainer reserves the right to silently fix it without immediately publicly disclosing the existence of nature of the vulnerability.

In such a scenario, the disclosure process used by [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/) is as follows:

1.  Silently fix the vulnerability and include the fix in release X.
2.  After 4-8 weeks, disclose that release X contained a security fix.
3.  After an additional 4-8 weeks, publish details of the vulnerability, along with credit to the reporter (with express permission from the reporter).

### Rights of Maintainers

Alongside this policy, maintainers also reserve the right to:

*   Bypass this policy and publish details on a shorter timeline.
*   Directly notify a subset of downstream users prior to making a public announcement.

This policy is based the [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) team’s [silent patch policy](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities#why-silent-patches).
