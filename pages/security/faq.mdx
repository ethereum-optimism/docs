# OP Mainnet Security Model

OP Mainnet is a work in progress.
Constant, iterative improvement of the security mechanisms that safeguard OP Mainnet users is a top priority.
At the moment, **it’s important to understand that the security of OP Mainnet is dependent on a [multisig wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/)** managed by several anonymous individuals.
This multisig wallet can be used to upgrade core OP Mainnet smart contracts without upgrade delays. For more information, see [Optimism’s Security Council](https://optimism.help/Token+House+Governance/Security+Council/Intro+to+Optimism's+Security+Council).

<Callout type="info">
  Please also read this [Community Notice](https://www.optimism.io/community-notice) containing important information about OP Mainnet, its security model, and the Optimism Foundation.
</Callout>

Please also keep in mind that just like any other system, **the Optimism codebase may contain unknown bugs** that could lead to the loss of some or all of the assets held within the system.
todo(fix link):[2222 smart contract codebase has been audited repeatedly](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/technical-documents/security-reviews) but **audits are not a stamp of approval** and **a completed audit does not mean that the audited codebase is free of bugs.**
It’s important to understand that using OP Mainnet inherently exposes you to the risk of bugs within the Optimism codebase, and that you use OP Mainnet at your own risk.

## Next gen fault proofs

As part of the OVM 2.0 upgrade, the **Optimism fault proof mechanism had to be temporarily disabled**. This means that users of the OP Mainnet network currently need to trust the Sequencer node (run by Optimism Foundation) to publish valid state roots to Ethereum. **You can also read more about our [security model](/resources/security-policy)**.

We're making progress on the upgrade fault proof mechanism and we expect to productionize our work in 2023. You can keep up with developments in the [Cannon repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/cannon/).

## Decentralizing the sequencer

Currently, the Optimism Foundation runs the sole sequencer on OP Mainnet. This does not mean that Optimism can censor user transactions. However, it is still desirable to decentralize the sequencer over time, eliminating Optimism's role entirely so that anyone can participate in the network as a block producer.

The first step to decentralizing the sequencer is to still have one sequencer at a time, but rotate that sequencer with some frequency. The precise mechanic for sequencer rotation is not yet finalized, but will involve two components:

-   an **economic mechanism** which creates a competitive market for sequencing, and redirects excess sequencer profits [towards protocol development](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c).
-   a **governance mechanism** which prevents sequencers from prioritizing short-term profits over the long-term health of the network.

After this, the next step is to support multiple concurrent sequencers. This can be simply achieved by adopting a standard BFT consensus protocol, as used by other L1 protocols and sidechains like Polygon and Cosmos.

You can keep up with the roadmap progress in todo(update link):[Cannon repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/cannon/) for the fault proofs and [Optimism specs repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/specs) for the overall protocol work.

## Security Model FAQ

### Does OP Mainnet have fault proofs?

**No**, OP Mainnet does not currently have fault proofs.
**Fault proofs do not meaningfully improve the security of a system if that system can be upgraded within the 7 day challenge window (”fast upgrade keys”)**.
A system with fast upgrade keys, such as OP Mainnet, is fully dependent on the upgrade keys for security.
OP Mainnet's goal is to be the first system that deploys fault proofs that can secure the system by themselves, without fast upgrade keys.

### Who manages the multisig?

The multisig is managed by an anonymous set of individuals.
Members are anonymous in order to make the multisig more difficult to compromise.

### How is Optimism planning to remove the multisig?

Check out Optimism’s detailed [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/our-pragmatic-path-to-decentralization-cb5805ca43c1) post for a detailed view into how the multisig may be removed in a way that makes OP Mainnet the first chain with true fault proof security.

### How can I help make OP Mainnet more secure?

[OP Mainnet has one of the biggest bug bounties (ever)](/resources/security-policy).
You can earn up to $2,000,042 by finding critical bugs in the Optimism codebase.
You can also run your own verifier node to detect network faults.

### Where do I report bugs?

For details about reporting vulnerabilities and available bug bounty programs, see the [Security Policy](/resources/security-policy).
