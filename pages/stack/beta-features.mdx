# Beta Features

Welcome to the beta features overview. This section contains a list of the latest in-development features currently in the beta stage. Beta features are available for early access and feedback gathering, helping to refine and optimize these tools before a full release.

These features may undergo changes based on user feedback and ongoing improvements. The functionality and design may evolve. Explore the sections below for more information on individual beta features and participation in shaping their final release.

## What are beta features?

Beta features are early-stage functionalities available for testing and feedback. Access to beta features provides opportunities to try new tools and provide valuable input that directly influences their final versions.

## Benefits of using beta features

*   **Early access**: Be among the first to use the latest innovations.
*   **Influence Development**: Your feedback plays a critical role in helping us refine and optimize these features.
*   **Enhanced Product Understanding**: Working with beta features can provide insights into the future direction of our product and how it will evolve.

## Key Considerations

When using beta features, please keep the following in mind:

*   **Functionality May Vary**: Since these features are still under development, there may be occasional bugs or performance issues.
*   **Limited Support**: Support for beta features may be limited, and these features are not recommended for critical production environments.
*   **Continuous Updates**: Beta features will be updated frequently based on user feedback, which means they may undergo significant changes during the testing phase.

## How to provide feedback

Feedback from beta users helps improve and refine these features. Here's how to contribute:

1.  **Document Your Experience**: Take note of any issues, suggestions, or enhancements you'd like to see.
2.  **Report Through Official Channels**: Submit feedback and bug reports through the optimism [monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues).
3.  **Participate in Surveys**: Occasionally, we'll send surveys to beta users. Participating in these helps us prioritize improvements.
