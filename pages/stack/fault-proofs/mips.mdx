# Fault proof VM: MIPS.sol

The `MIPS.sol` smart contract is an onchain implementation of a big-endian virtual machine (VM) that encompasses the MIPS32 R1 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
This smart contract is the counterpart to the off-chain MIPSEVM golang implementation of the same ISA. Together, the onchain and off-chain VM implementations make up [Cannon](cannon),
Optimism's Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM). Cannon is a singular instance of a FPVM that can be used as part of the Dispute Game for Optimism's (and Base's) optimistic rollup L2 blockchain.
The Dispute Game itself is modular, allowing for any FPVM to be used in a dispute; however, Cannon is currently the only FPVM implemented and thus will be used in all disputes.

## Control flow

The `FaultDisputeGame.sol` interacts with `MIPS.sol` and then `MIPS.sol` calls into `PreimageOracle.sol`. `MIPS.sol` is only called at the max depth of the game when someone needs to call `step`.
`FaultDisputeGame.sol` is the deployed instance of a Fault Dispute Game for an active dispute, and `PreimageOracle.sol` stores Pre-images.

*   Pre-images contain data from both L1 and L2, which includes information such as block headers, transactions, receipts, world state nodes, and more. Pre-images are used as the inputs to the derivation process used to calculate the true L2 state, and subsequently the true L2 state is used to resolve a dispute game.
*   A Fault Dispute Game, at a high-level, will effectively determine what L2 state is currently agreed-upon, and move through L2 state until the first disagreed-upon state is found. How the Pre-images are determined and populated into the `PreimageOracle.sol` contract is out-of-scope for this reference document on the `MIPS.sol` contract, as that contract only consumes Pre-images that have already been populated by the off-chain Cannon implementation.

The `MIPS.sol` contract is called by a running instance of a dispute game (i.e. by a `FaultDisputeGame.sol` contract), and is only called once a dispute game reaches a leaf node in the state transition tree that is currently being disputed.
A leaf node represents a single MIPS instruction (in the case that we're using Cannon as the FPVM) that can then be run onchain. Given a Pre-image, which is the previously agreed-upon L2 state up until this instruction, and the instruction
state to run in the `MIPS.sol` contract, the fault dispute game can determine the true post state (or Post-image). This true post state will then be used to determine the outcome of the fault dispute game by comparing the disputed post-state
at the leaf node with the post-state proposed by the disputer.

## Contract state

The `MIPS.sol` contract only contains a single immutable variable, which corresponds to the address of the `PreimageOracle.sol` contract.
Otherwise, the contract is stateless, meaning that all state related to playing a MIPS instruction onchain comes from either the `FaultDisputeGame.sol` instance, or the `PreimageOracle.sol`.
Having a stateless `MIPS.sol` contract means that it can be used by any fault dispute game that is using the Cannon FPVM; the `MIPS.sol` contract does not need to be re-deployed per fault dispute game instance.
Subsequently, any fault dispute game that is using the same `MIPS.sol` contract will also share the same `PreimageOracle.sol` contract.
Note that the `PreimageOracle.sol` contract is stateful, but how state is stored in the contract and differentiated between different fault dispute game instances is out-of-scope for this document.

While the `MIPS.sol` contract is stateless, meaning it does not store state in the contract directly, the contract does require up to 3 different types of witness data in order to perform a single MIPS instruction onchain:

*   Packed VM execution state
*   Memory proofs
*   Pre-images

The Pre-images have already been discussed above, so we will discuss the packed VM execution state and the memory proofs.
As a final note on Pre-images during onchain execution, it is entirely possible that the `MIPS.sol` contract never runs a MIPS instruction onchain that requires the contract to read from `PreimageOracle.sol` .
There is no requirement to read from the `PreimageOracle.sol` during instruction execution, but that doesn't mean the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract is not being used.
The Pre-image information that has been read in previous off-chain instructions leading up to the execution of a single instruction onchain may still reside in the constructed VM memory.
Thus, even when the instruction run onchain does not explicitly read from `PreimageOracle.sol` , Pre-image data may still influence the merkle root that represents the VM's memory.

### Packed VM execution state

In order to execute a MIPS instruction onchain, the `MIPS.sol` contract needs to know important state information such as the instruction to run, the values in each of the general purpose registers, etc.
More specifically, a tightly-packed `State` struct contains all the relevant information that the `MIPS.sol` contract needs to know. This struct is passed to the contract from the `FaultDisputeGame.sol` contract when it invokes the `step` function in `MIPS.sol` (which in-turn executes a single MIPS instruction onchain).
The following information is stored in the `State` struct. See [doc reference](https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/cannon-fault-proof-vm.html#state) and [code reference](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L26) for details:

1.  `memRoot` - The merkle root hash of the binary merkle tree that represents the MIPS VM's monolithic 32-bit memory space.
2.  `preimageKey` - Key that uniquely identifies the Pre-image data to be read (if applicable) from the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract.
3.  `preimageOffset` - Each Pre-image is 32 bytes long, however the word size for 32-bit MIPS is 4 bytes. Therefore, only 4 bytes from a Pre-image will be read during a read syscall. The `preimageOffset` serves as the offset into the Pre-image being read, so that an instruction can continue reading a Pre-image 4 bytes at a time.
4.  `pc` - The program counter, which points to the memory location that contains the MIPS instruction to execute onchain.
5.  `nextPC` - The next program counter, which functions similarly to the program counter except that it points to the next instruction to be executed onchain. Note that the next instruction may or may not be `PC + 8` in the event of a branch or jump instruction. Additionally, the `nextPC` effectively functions as the [branch delay slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture#cpu_instructions) for the MIPS ISA.
6.  `lo` - Special purpose 32-bit register that stores the low-order 32-bits from certain multiplication instructions (or special move instructions that store into this register).
7.  `hi` - Special purpose 32-bit register that stores the high-order 32-bits from certain multiplication instructions (or special move instructions that store into this register)
8.  `heap` - Pointer to the most recent memory allocation returned via the `mmap` syscall.
9.  `exitCode` - `uint8` value that represents UNIX exit status code of the VM.
10. `exited` - Boolean that indicates whether the VM has exited or not.
11. `step` - Counts the total number of instructions that have been executed.
12. `registers` - Array of 32, 32-bit values that represent the general purpose registers for the MIPS ISA.

### State hash

The state hash is the `bytes32` value returned to the active Fault Dispute Game upon the completion of a single MIPS instruction in the `MIPS.sol` contract.
The hash is derived by taking the `keccak256` of the above packed VM execution `State` struct, then replacing the first byte of the hash with a value that represents the status of the VM.
This value is derived from the `exitCode` and `exited` values, and can be:

*   Valid (0)
*   Invalid (1)
*   Panic (2) or
*   Unfinished (3)

The reason for adding the VM status to the state hash is to communicate to the dispute game whether the VM determined the proposed output root was valid or not.
This in turn prevents a user from disputing an output root during a dispute game, while providing the state hash from a cannon trace that actually proves the output root is valid.

### Memory proofs

Using a 32-bit ISA means that the total size of the address space (assuming no virtual address space) is `2^32 = 4GiB`. Additionally, the `MIPS.sol` contract is stateless, so it does not store the MIPS memory in contract storage. The primary reason for this is because having to load the entire memory into the `MIPS.sol` contract in order to execute a single instruction onchain is prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the entire memory would need to be loaded per fault proof game, requiring multiple instances of the `MIPS.sol` contract. Therefore, in order to optimize the amount of data that needs to be provided per onchain instruction execution while still maintaining integrity over the entire 32-bit address space, Optimism has converted the memory into a binary merkle tree.

The binary merkle tree (i.e. hash tree) used to store the memory of the MIPS VM has leaf values that are 32 bytes and has a fixed depth of 27 levels. This in turn allows the binary merkle tree to span the full 32-bit address space: `2^27 * 32 = 2^32` (See [memory proofs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/cannon/docs/README.md#memory-proofs) for more details). In order to ensure the integrity of the entire address space each time memory is read or written to, one or more memory proofs are provided by the FaultDisputeGame.sol contract each time a MIPS instruction is executed onchain in MIPS.sol. A memory proof consists of the current leaf value and 27 sibling nodes (28, 32-byte values in total), where the sibling nodes are the `keccak256` hash of its own child nodes. Using the leaf value, its 27 sibling nodes, and the memory address converted to its binary representation as a guide (0 or 1 tells the order to concatenate left and right values), we can calculate a merkle root. This merkle root should be exactly the same as the merkle root stored in the VM execution State struct.

Reading to memory and writing to memory work similarly, both involve calculating the merkle root. In the case of a memory write, `MIPS.sol` must take care to verify that the provided proof for the memory location to write to is correct. Additionally, writing to memory will change the merkle root stored in the VM execution `State` struct.

### State calculation

While the MIPS.sol contract may only execute a single instruction onchain, the off-chain Cannon implementation executes all prerequisite MIPS instructions for all state transitions in the disputed L2 state. These transitions are required to reach the disputed instruction that will be executed onchain. This ensures that the MIPS instruction executed onchain has the correct VM state and necessary Pre-images stored in the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract to generate the true post-state that can be used to resolve the dispute game.

## Functions

### oracle

The external view [`oracle`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L65) function is a getter function that returns the PreimageOracle address cast as a `IPreimageOracle` interface.

### SE

The internal pure [`SE`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L70) function performs a sign-extension (SE) on the provided `uint32` value given the number of bits that currently represents the value. While the function operates over an unsigned integer, it follows the typical procedure for [sign-extension of signed values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#Sign_extension) represented using two's complement.

### outputState

The internal [`outputState`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L81) function computes the `keccak256` hash of all values in the VM execution `State` struct, and then masks the first two bits of the hash with the current status of the VM as derived from the `exitCode` and `exited` values. Despite the complexity of the function (due to the use of assembly), the implementation is effectively tightly packing all the variables in the `State` struct together, then taking the `keccak256` of the packed bytes. A Solidity equivalent implementation can be viewed in the [`outputState`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/test/MIPS.t.sol#L1574) function located in the foundry test suite.

### handleSyscall

The internal [`handleSyscall`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L145) function handles the syscall MIPS instruction. Only a subset of all syscall numbers are supported by the `MIPS.sol` contract; however, any syscall that is not explicitly supported will return 0s instead of reverting. Most syscalls that are supported partially mimic the behavior specified by the linux manual pages. The two most important syscall numbers that are supported are read and write.

#### syscall read

When given file descriptor 5 as the target of the read syscall, `handleSyscall` will call the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract to read a 32-byte Pre-image at the current location determined by the `preimageKey` stored in the VM execution `State` struct. Once the 32-byte Pre-image has been read, the function will then determine the number of bytes to read (up to 4 bytes) and the location in memory to store the bytes. The number of bytes to read may be any value between 1 and 4, depending on the alignment of the offset in the returned Pre-image and the alignment of the memory position to write the data to.

#### syscall write

When given the file descriptor 6 as the target of the write syscall, `handleSyscall` will not call the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract to write a new Pre-image. Only the off-chain Cannon implementation writes to the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract. Instead, the function computes the new value of the `preimageKey` given the 4-byte value that would be written to the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract. Additionally, the function resets the `preimageOffset` to 0. It is expected that the off-chain Cannon implementation has already written the data to the `PreimageOracle.sol`  contract at the location of the newly-derived `preimageKey`.

### handleBranch

The internal [`handleBranch`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L313) function handles the multiple branch opcodes and conforms to the MIPS specification for the instructions.

### handleHiLo

The internal [`handleHiLo`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L377) function handles the multiplication, division, and move opcodes that interact with the `hi` and `lo` registers and conforms to the MIPS specification for the instructions.

### handleJump

The internal [`handleJump`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L448) function handles J-type opcodes and conforms to the MIPS specification for the instructions.

### handleRd

The internal [`handleRd`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L480) function handles storing a value into a specified register. Certain instructions may include a conditional value, which determines whether the value is stored in the register or not.

### proofOffset

The internal pure [`proofOffset`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L508) function handles calculating the offset in calldata to the start of a memory proof given an index. The calldata is provided to this function via the top-level `step` function call. Looking at the calldata, there are two bytes values passed: `stateData` and `proof`. The `bytes stateData` value is the packed VM execution `State` struct, and the `bytes proof` value represents one or more memory proofs that may be necessary for the onchain execution of the MIPS instruction. The `stateData` and memory proof(s) are encoded in calldata using the [Solidity ABI encoding specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html). Using this information, we can derive the hardcoded values that are being used in the `proofOffset` function:

| Offset Description                                                   | Num. Bytes     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|                                                                      | 32             | Contains the offset to the first dynamic bytes argument aka `stateData`                                                                                                                    |

|                                                                      | 32             | Contains the length of the first dynamic bytes argument `stateData`                                                                                                                        |

### readMem

The internal pure [`readMem`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L526) function is a helper function that, given a 32-bit address and an index to a memory proof in calldata, validates the leaf node using the memory proof and then returns the specific 4-byte value to read. Note that a leaf node is 32-bytes so at most `readMem` will only read 4-bytes due to the 32-bit MIPS architecture. The validation given a leaf node and its 27 sibling nodes follows the standard logic for verifying inclusion in a merkle tree. The address is used as the path in order to determine the order for hashing two nodes (or the leaf and a node) together. Once the top of the tree has been reached, and the merkle root calculated, the calculated root is checked against the merkle root stored in the VM execution `State` struct. Once the leaf node has been verified, the logic will shift to the correct location within the 32-bytes value to read from. Also note that `readMem` will always start at an aligned 4-byte location; therefore it is up to subsequent logic to determine the correct position within a 4-byte word in unaligned memory read or write situations.

### writeMem

The internal pure [`writeMem`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L580) function is a helper function that, given a 32-bit address, an index to a memory proof in calldata, and a 32-bit value to write, calculates the new merkle root of the VM execution `State` struct.
Calculating the new merkle root follows the same logic as in the `readMem` function, except that the new value will be stored in the State struct. Note that `writeMem` does not verify the proof used to calculate the new merkle root.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is **critically important** that the memory proof being used is verified beforehand by calling the `readMem` function.
</Callout>

Also note that `writeMem`, similar to `readMem`, only works over 4-byte aligned words. Therefore, it is up to the logic that calls `writeMem` to generate a value to write such that if an unaligned memory write occurs, the value already reflects that.

### step

The public [`step`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L624) function is the top-level call that executes a single MIPS instruction. This function will be called by an active dispute game in order to determine the true post state given a pre state and a MIPS instruction to run. At a high-level, the function performs the following steps:

1.  Verifies and unpacks the stateData variable into the VM execution `State` struct (in memory).
2.  Reads the instruction located at the program counter (`pc`).
3.  Interprets and executes the MIPS instruction according to the MIPS specification.
4.  Writes results to registers or memory (if applicable) and updates the VM execution `State` struct accordingly.

### execute

The internal pure [`execute`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/546fb2c7a5796b7fe50b0b7edc7666d3bd281d6f/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS.sol#L793) function handles the execution of MIPS instructions that are not handled by other functions. The `execute` function primarily handles R-type instructions according to the MIPS specification, however other instructions will pass through this function. Instructions handled by other functions will simply return. Invalid or unsupported instructions will cause the `execute` function to revert.

## Common bitwise operation use cases

1.  Isolating certain bits from a number can be done using the & operator (and(x,y) in Yul), this is also known as generating a bitmask.
2.  Combining bits from two numbers together can be done using the | operator (or(x, y) in Yul).
3.  Modulo arithmetic can be expressed using the following bitwise operation: `x % y = x & (y - 1), ex. x % 4 = x & 3.` Note this is only equivalent for unsigned integers.
4.  Multiplication using a value with a base of 2 can be expressed using the following bitwise operation: `x * y = x << z, where y = 2^z`
    Ex. `x * 8 = x << 3, where 8 = 2^3`
