# Custom Gas Token: Your Guide to Using Native Assets for Gas

Welcome! This guide explains how Custom Gas Token (CGT) works and what it means for you as a user or developer working with OP Stack chains.

## What is Custom Gas Token?

Think of Custom Gas Token as a way for blockchain networks to use their own special currency instead of ETH to pay for transaction fees. It's like a store that accepts its own gift cards instead of cash – you can still buy what you need, but you use a different payment method.

Instead of paying gas fees with ETH, you'll pay with the network's native token. This opens up exciting possibilities for different types of blockchain economics and features.

## How it works

### The basics

When a network enables Custom Gas Token, you can no longer use ETH to pay for transactions. Instead, the network's own token becomes the currency for gas fees. This change allows networks to create unique ways to distribute and manage their tokens, opening up new economic possibilities.

### Key components you should know about

**Native Asset Liquidity**
This is like a big vault that holds the network's native tokens. Think of it as the main supply storage.

**Liquidity Controller**
This acts like a smart manager that controls who can access tokens from the vault. It ensures only authorized systems can mint (create) or burn (destroy) tokens.

**Wrapped Native Asset (WNA)**
Just like WETH wraps ETH, WNA wraps the native token so it can work with applications that expect ERC-20 tokens.

## What this means for you

### As a regular user

Getting native tokens depends on the specific network you're using. You might exchange other tokens for native tokens through a converter, bridge tokens from another blockchain, or receive them directly from the network.

Once you have native tokens, using them is straightforward. They work just like ETH – they automatically get deducted when you make transactions. However, since each network handles native tokens differently, you'll want to check the network's documentation to understand how to move tokens in and out.

### As a developer

There are some key differences when working with CGT-enabled chains compared to ETH-based chains. Standard ETH deposit and withdrawal functions are disabled, so you'll need to integrate with the network's specific token management system. Native token acquisition methods also vary by implementation.

The good news is that much stays the same. Transaction structure and gas calculation work similarly to what you're used to. Smart contracts deploy and function normally, and most development tools work without changes.

## Benefits of Custom Gas Token

Custom Gas Token opens up new possibilities for both networks and users. Networks can create unique economic models, use existing tokens as native assets, implement custom supply management, and enable novel bridging mechanisms. This flexibility allows for innovation in how blockchain economics work.

For users, the main advantages include paying gas with tokens you already hold, participating in network-specific economics, and accessing unique features tied to the native token. This can make the user experience more integrated and potentially more cost-effective depending on the token economics.

## Things to keep in mind

### Flexibility comes with variety

Since each CGT-enabled network can implement token management differently, it's important to read each network's specific documentation. You'll want to understand whether the native token comes from an existing ERC-20, a new token, or other mechanisms. If you're moving tokens between networks, make sure you understand and verify the security of the bridging mechanism being used.

### Security considerations

Only authorized systems can manage the token supply, with the network's governance controlling who gets minting permissions. This makes smart contract audits especially important for token management contracts. The security model is designed to prevent unauthorized token creation or destruction.

## Getting started

Getting started with a Custom Gas Token network involves a few straightforward steps. First, choose an OP Stack network that uses Custom Gas Token. Next, follow the network's specific process to acquire native tokens. Once you have tokens, you can start transacting using them just like you'd use ETH for gas. Finally, explore any unique features that the network offers tied to their native tokens.

## Common scenarios

### Scenario 1: L1 ERC-20 as native token

If the network uses an existing L1 token, you'll bridge your L1 tokens to the L2 network where they become your gas currency. You can then use these bridged tokens for all transactions on the network.

### Scenario 2: L2-native token

If the network created its own token, you'll need to acquire tokens through the network's specific distribution method. These tokens often serve dual purposes, functioning both for utility or governance and as the gas payment method. Many of these networks also offer an ERC-20 version for use in DeFi applications.

### Scenario 3: No existing token dependency

Some networks create entirely new economic models where tokens might be earned through network participation. These networks often have unique supply schedules and economics that differ significantly from traditional models.

## Need help?

If you need assistance, start by checking your specific network's documentation for detailed instructions. Look for network-specific developer guides and examples if you're building applications. You can also join the network's community channels for support from other users and developers.

Remember, while the core concept is consistent across CGT networks, implementation details vary. Always consult your specific network's documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
