# Anatomy of a cross-chain message

A cross-chain message refers to any communication sent using Superchain interop. This includes messages sent between different chains within an interop cluster, as well as messages sent on a single chain for interoperable. This functionality enables asset transfers that utilize the [SuperchainERC20](superchain-erc20) token standard.

## How it works

To send a cross-chain message on the Superchain using [Superchain interoperability](explainer), these two aspects must be in place:

1.  Each interoperable chain runs a verifying node for each chain in the interoperable set.
2.  Each cross-chain message has an **initiating transaction** on the source chain and a **finalizing transaction** on the destination chain.
    *   **First/initiating transaction:** is submitted to the source chain and emits an event that can be consumed on a destination chain.
    *   **Second/finalizing transaction:** is submitted to a destination chain, where the block builder should only include it if certain that the first transaction was included in the source chain. The block builder can use OP-Supervisor to determine the integrity of the initiating message. Anyone can submit the second transaction.
<Callout type="default">
  There is no strict requirement that the executing message is ever submitted. See the specs for details on tracing the [executing message event](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#executingmessage-event).
</Callout>

In the example above, `Ox123` sends 1 OP from OP Mainnet to Base, but this applies to any asset using the SuperchainERC20 token standard.
