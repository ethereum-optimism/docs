This guide provides an overview of cross-chain message passing in the Superchain.

## Overview

The Superchain uses a pull-based event system for cross-chain communication. Messages are sent through the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` contract, which provides a secure and standardized way to pass information between chains.

## How it works

The following diagram illustrates how messages flow between chains through the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` contract, which acts as a bridge for cross-chain communication. When a contract on the source chain initiates a message, it's processed through several stages before reaching its destination, ensuring secure and reliable message delivery.

    participant Dest as Destination Chain
    
    Note over Source,Dest: Message Creation
    Source->>Messenger: Emit message event
    Note over Source,Dest: Message Serialization
    Messenger-->>Messenger: Convert to standard format
    Note over Source,Dest: Identifier Creation
    Messenger-->>Messenger: Generate unique ID
    Note over Source,Dest: Message Execution
    Messenger->>Dest: Process message
```

Cross-chain messaging involves four main phases:

1.  **Message Creation**: The source chain contract emits an event containing the message data and destination information. This event serves as the initiating message that will be relayed across chains.

2.  **Message Serialization**: The messenger contract converts the event data into a standardized format that can be consistently processed across different chains in the Superchain.

3.  **Identifier Creation**: A unique identifier is generated for the message, containing information about its `origin`, `timestamp`, and other `metadata`. This identifier helps track and verify the message.

4.  **Message Execution**: The destination chain receives and processes the message, executing any associated actions or state changes specified in the original message.

## Common Use Cases

*   Simple messages between identical contracts
*   Complex multi-contract interactions
*   Cross-chain state synchronization
*   Token transfers and bridging
