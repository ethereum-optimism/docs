# Interop message passing overview

<Callout>
  This is an explanation of how interop works.
  You can find a step by step tutorial [here](/stack/interop/tutorials/message-passing).
</Callout>

The low-level [`CrossL2Inbox`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol) contract handles basic message execution. It verifies whether an initiating message exists but does not check the message's destination, processing status, or other attributes.

The [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol) contract extends `CrossL2Inbox` by providing complete cross-domain messaging functionality.

For high-level interoperability, both messages use the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` contract on their respective chains.

## Initiating message

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant app as Application
    box rgba(0,0,0,0.1) Source Chain
      participant srcContract as Source Contract
      participant srcXdom as L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger
      participant log as Event Log
    end
    app->>srcContract: 1. Send a message
    srcContract->>srcXdom: 2. Call contract A<br/>in chainId B<br/>with calldata C
    note over srcXdom: 3. Sanity checks
    srcXdom->>log: 4. Log event SentMessage
    
```

1.  The application sends a transaction to a contract on the source chain.

2.  The contract calls [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.SendMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L125-L142).
    The call requires these parameters:

    *   `_destination`: The chain ID of the destination blockchain.
    *   `_target`: The address of the contract on that blockchain.
    *   `_message`: The actual message.
    
    This message is provided to `_target` as calldata, which means it includes a function selector and the parameters for that function call.

3.  `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` on the source chain verifies the message is legitimate:
    *   The destination chain is one to which this chain can send messages.
    *   The destination chain is *not* the source chain.
    *   The target is neither `CrossL2Inbox` nor `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`.

4.  `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` emits a log entry.
    In addition to the parameters, the log entry also includes:

    *   `_nonce`: A [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) value to ensure the message is only executed once.

    *   `_sender`: The contract that sent the cross domain message.

## Executing message

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant app as Autorelayer
    box rgba(0,0,0,0.1) Source Chain
      participant log as Event Log
    end    
    participant super as OP-Supervisor<br/>(destination chain<br/>node)
    box rgba(0,0,0,0.1) Destination Chain
      participant dstXdom as L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger
      participant Xinbox as CrossL2Inbox
      participant dstContract as Destination Contract
    end
    log->>super: 1. Initiating message log event
    app->>dstXdom: 2. Send an executing message
    dstXdom->>Xinbox: 3. Verify the initiating message is real 
    note over dstXdom: 4. Sanity checks
    dstXdom->>dstContract: 5. Call with provided calldata
```

1.  Before the executing message is processed, the log event of the initiating message has to get to `op-supervisor` on the destination chain.

2.  The autorelayer, the application, or a contract calling on the application's behalf calls [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L150-L203).
    This call includes the message that was sent (`_sentMessage`), as well as the [fields required to find that message (`_id`)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/interfaces/L2/ICrossL2Inbox.sol#L4-L10).

3.  The `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` uses `CrossL2Inbox` to verify the message was sent from the source.

4.  `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` on the destination chain verifies the message is legitimate:

    *   The origin (of the log entry) is `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` on the other side.
    *   The destination chain ID is correct.
    *   The target is neither `CrossL2Inbox` nor `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`.
    *   This message has not been relayed before.
    
    This is the reason we need the nonce value, to enable us to send multiple messages that would be otherwise identical.

5.  If everything checks out, `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` calls the destination contract with the calldata provided in the message.
