# OP Supervisor

OP Supervisor is a critical service designed to verify cross-chain messages and manage the safety of interoperability between different chains in the OP Stack. It acts as a hub for indexing data that every `op-node` needs to cross-verify with other chains.
Some features and benefits include:

*   Enables secure cross-chain message passing on the Superchain
*   Provides a centralized point for managing interoperability data
*   Supports multiple networks simultaneously
*   Offers potential for public endpoints to aid in node synchronization

## Cross-chain message verification

Verifies messages between different chains in the OP Stack, reducing the risk of invalid or malicious cross-chain interactions.⁠ It centralizes the verification process, which reduces the complexity of operating individual nodes⁠.⁠

*   `op-geth`: queries `op-supervisor` during block-building to verify if a message is sufficiently safe to include. This process involves checking each executing message and potentially undoing transactions if conflicts or unknown states are encountered.
*   `op-node`: queries cross-chain safety information and coordinates safety updates between OP stack nodes and `op-supervisor`. It uses the API provided by `op-supervisor` to perform actions like:
    *   Updating and retrieving various safety levels
    *   Checking and returning the `cross-unsafe` head for a given chain
    *   Attempting to promote a block to `cross-safe` status
    *   Attempting to finalize an L2 block based on L1 finality

## Log data indexing and management

Acts as a hub for indexing data that every `op-node` needs to cross-verify with other chains, centralizing the process of managing interoperability data. Maintains the integrity of cross-chain interactions by tracking safety changes⁠ across the Superchain, ensuring consistent application of invalid dependency resolutions. ⁠

`op-supervisor` indexes two types of cross-chain dependencies:

*   Interop messages (events): `op-supervisor` maintains an events-index per L2 chain, which determines message-dependencies to check if blocks are safe
*   L1 DA (data availability): `op-supervisor` tracks the L1 DA for L2 blocks and maintains a DA safety-index per L2 chain, which helps determine how to rewind L2 chains to resolve invalid dependencies

## API for cross-chain safety

Provides an interface for `op-node` to query cross-chain safety information and coordinate safety updates between OP stack nodes and `op-supervisor⁠⁠`. OP-Supervisor uses a global read API to determine **message safety** and **block safety,** utilizing both the events index and the safety index (See op-supervisor's [safe data indexing](#safe-data-indexing-and-management)). The API is designed to handle potential L1 reorgs that can affect the validity of cross-chain messages⁠.

Key API methods include:

| Method                                    | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UnsafeView` and `SafeView`               | Returns the Local and Cross heads for their respective levels                         |
| `DerivedFrom`                             | OP Nodes use to check the L1 source of the Supervisor (needed for Safe Head tracking) |
| `UpdateLocalSafe` and `UpdateLocalUnsafe` | Tells the Supervisor when the Node's heads change                                     |
| `Finalized`                               | Returns the Finalized Head                                                            |
| `UpdateFinalizedL1`                       | Signals to the Supervisor new finality signals                                        |
| `CheckMessage`                            | Checks logs in the DB directly in tests, can also use `CheckMessages` in geth         |

## RPC access to all chains

The `op-supervisor` requires RPC access to all chains in the dependency set. This allows `op-supervisor` to verify cross-chain messages and sync data across multiple networks simultaneously, such as OP Mainnet and Base nodes using the same instance.

Benefits of this approach:

*   Cost-effective: Running `op-supervisor` is cheaper than running a full node for each chain in the dependency set.
*   Scalability: As the number of chains in the Superchain grows, `op-supervisor` can handle the increasing complexity of cross-chain interactions.
*   Improved reliability: It enables a more redundant setup, which is good for stability in the growing ecosystem.
