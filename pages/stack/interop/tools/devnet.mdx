# Interop devnet

<Callout>
  Interop devnet is currently in active development and may experience periods of instability, including potential outages, as the networks are regularly updated and improved. Developers should expect some level of unreliability when interacting with the devnet. The devnet is intended for testing and development purposes only, and should not be relied upon for mission-critical applications.
</Callout>

The Interop devnet is a temporary public network of two OP Stack Sepolia instances that support Superchain interop enabling native ETH and SuperchainERC20 cross-chain token transfers. As we iterate on Superchain interop, these networks will be deprecated once the next devnets are released.

1.  The "currency symbol" is required by some wallets like MetaMask.
2.  The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1 and L2. You can send `ETH` directly to the portal to receive it to the sender address on the L2.

## Sending ETH to the interop devnets

<Steps>
  ### Get Sepolia ETH

  You can utilize the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) to get ether on Sepolia.

  ### Send the Sepolia ETH to the devnet

  You can send ether directly to the `OptimismPortal` address and it will go to the same sender address on the devnet.

  ### Wait for bridging to complete

  It'll take approximately 2 minutes for the bridging process to complete and the ether to appear in your wallet.
</Steps>

## Next steps

*   Review the [Superchain Interop Explainer](../explainer) for answers to common questions about interoperability.
*   Read the [Message Passing Explainer](../message-passing) to understand what happens "under the hood".
*   Write a revolutionary app that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
