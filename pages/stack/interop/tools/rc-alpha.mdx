# Release Candidate - Alpha

<Callout>
  Release candidate - Alpha devnet is currently in active development and may experience periods of instability, including potential outages, as the networks are regularly updated and improved. Developers should expect some level of unreliability when interacting with the devnet. The devnet is intended for protocol testing only, and should not be relied upon for mission-critical applications.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Release Candidate - Alpha is meant only for protocol testing. If you're an application developer looking to test your interop-enabled application we recommend using the [Superchain interop devnet](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/tools/devnet).

1.  The "currency symbol" is required by some wallets like MetaMask.
2.  The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1 and L2. You can send `ETH` directly to the portal to receive it to the sender address on the L2.

## Bridging ETH to the Release Candidate - Alpha devnet

<Steps>
  ### Get Sepolia ETH from the Superchain Faucet

  You can utilize the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) to get `ETH` on Sepolia.

  ### Send the Sepolia ETH to the devnet

  You can send `ETH` directly to the `OptimismPortal` address and it will go to the same sender address on the devnet.

  ### Wait for bridging to complete

  It'll take approximately 2 minutes for the bridging process from Sepolia to L2 to complete and the `ETH` to appear in your wallet.
</Steps>

## Next steps

*   Build a [revolutionary app](/app-developers/get-started) that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
*   Deploy a [SuperchainERC20](/stack/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20) to the Superchain
*   View more [interop tutorials](/stack/interop/tutorials)
