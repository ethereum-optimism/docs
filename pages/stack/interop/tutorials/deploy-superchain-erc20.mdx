# Deploying a SuperchainERC20

## Overview

This guide explains how to issue new assets with the [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) contract.
Those assets can then be bridged quickly and safely using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract (once interop is operational).
For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20).

Note that bridging assets through the Superchain using `SuperchainTokenBridge` *never* affects the total supply of your asset.
The supply remains fixed, bridging only changes the chain on which the asset is located.
The token's total amount across all networks always remains the same, ensuring value stability.

To ensure fungibility across chains, `SuperchainERC20` assets *must* have the same contract address on all chains.
This requirement abstracts away the complexity of cross-chain validation.
Achieving this requires deterministic deployment methods. There are multiple ways to do this.
Here we will use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit).

### What you'll do

*   Use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit) to deploy an `SuperchainERC20` token on the devnet.

### What you'll learn

*   How to deploy `SuperchainERC20` tokens on different chains at the same address.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

### Technical knowledge

*   Understanding of smart contract development
*   Familiarity with blockchain concepts

### Development environment

*   Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
*   Git for version control

### Required tools

The tutorial uses these primary tools:

*   Foundry: For sending transactions to blockchains.

## Step by step explanation

<Steps>
  ### Install the prerequisites and the SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit

  Follow the setup steps in the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit#setup).

  ### Prepare for deployment

  The Starter Kit already deploys a `SuperchainERC20` token to [Supersim](/stack/interop/tools/supersim).
  Here we will deploy it to the [Interop devnet](/stack/interop/tools/devnet).

  1.  Edit `packages/contracts/foundry.toml` to add the RPC endpoints for the devnet (add the bottom two rows).

      ```toml
      [rpc_endpoints]
      op_chain_a = "http://127.0.0.1:9545"
      op_chain_b = "http://127.0.0.1:9546"
      devnet0 = "https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io"
      devnet1 = "https://interop-alpha-1.optimism.io"
      ```

      You can import most RPC endpoints with this command, but it does not include the Interop devnet.

      ```sh
      pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
      ```

  2.  Edit `packages/contracts/configs/deploy-config.toml` for the deployment settings.  

      *   Set these parameters in the `[deploy-config]` section:

          | Parameter | Meaning                                       | Example                |
          | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
          | salt      | A unique identifier                           | Carthage               |
          | chains    | The chains to deploy the contract<sup>1</sup> | \["devnet0","devnet1"] |

          (1) These names must correspond to the chain names in the `[rpc-endpoints]` section of `foundry.toml` you updated in the previous step.

      *   Set these parameters in the `[token]` section:

          | Parameter      | Meaning                  | Example                  |                                            |
          | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
          | owner\_address | Owner of the token       | Your address<sup>1</sup> |                                            |
          | name           | Token name               | Quick Transfer Token     |                                            |
          | symbol         | Token symbol             | QTT                      |                                            |
          | decimals       | Number of decimal places | 18                       |                                            |

          (1) This should be an address you control (for which you know the private key), which has some ETH on the devnets.
          [See here](/stack/interop/tools/devnet#sending-eth-to-the-interop-devnets) to add ETH to the devnets.

      Here is a sample `packages/contracts/configs/deploy-config.toml` file you can use, as long as you update `owner_address`.

      ```toml
      [deploy_config]
      salt = "is the source of our word salary"
      chains = ["devnet0","devnet1"]

      [token]
      owner_address = "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
      name = "Quick Transfer Token"
      symbol = "QTT"
      decimals = 18
      ```

  3.  Set the private key.
      Edit `packages/contracts/.env` to set `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key of an account that has ETH on both devnet blockchains.

      ```sh
      DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY= <<<private key goes here>>>
      ```

  ### Deploy the contracts

  Run the deployment script.

  ```sh
  pnpm contracts:deploy:token
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>Sanity check</summary>

    1.  Set `TOKEN_ADDRESS` to the address where the token is deployed.

        ```sh
        TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x322f4aF25D370BE2A2C74eEFf0DD0d2AF2e7eD75
        ```

    2.  Set `PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key for the owner address.

        ```sh
        PRIVATE_KEY= <<<private key goes here>>>
        ```

    3.  Mint tokens for an address you control on both chains.
        The owner address is the easiest to use.

        ```sh
        OWNER_ADDRESS=`cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`
        RPC_DEV0=https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io
        RPC_DEV1=https://interop-alpha-1.optimism.io
        cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY $TOKEN_ADDRESS "mintTo(address,uint256)" $OWNER_ADDRESS 1000 --rpc-url $RPC_DEV0
        cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY $TOKEN_ADDRESS "mintTo(address,uint256)" $OWNER_ADDRESS 2000 --rpc-url $RPC_DEV1       
        ```

    4.  Check the balance of the owner address on both blockchains.

        ```sh
        cast call $TOKEN_ADDRESS "balanceOf(address)" $OWNER_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_DEV0 | cast to-dec        
        cast call $TOKEN_ADDRESS "balanceOf(address)" $OWNER_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_DEV1 | cast to-dec
        ```
  </details>
