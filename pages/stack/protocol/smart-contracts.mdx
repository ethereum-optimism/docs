# Smart Contract Overview

This guide explains how smart contracts work at a high level functionality
of the smart contract components. You can find their addresses on OP Mainnet 
[here](/chain/addresses).

## L1 contracts

### [DelayedVetoable](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/DelayedVetoable.sol)

This contract enables a delay before a call is forwarded to a target contract, 
and during the delay period the call can be vetoed by the authorized vetoer. 
This contract does not support value transfers, only data is forwarded. 
Additionally, this contract cannot be used to forward calls with data beginning 
with the function selector of the queuedAt(bytes32) function. This is because 
of input validation checks which solidity performs at runtime on functions 
which take an argument.

### [L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol)

The L1CrossDomainMessenger is a message passing interface between L1 and L2 
responsible for sending and receiving data on the L1 side. Users are encouraged 
to use this interface instead of interacting with lower-level contracts directly.

### [L1ERC721Bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol)

The `L1ERC721bridge` is a contract which works together with the L2 ERC721 bridge 
to make it possible to transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Optimism. This 
contract acts as an escrow for ERC721 tokens deposited into L2.

### [L1StandardBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1StandardBridge.sol)

<Callout type="warning">
  This contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
  of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
  not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
</Callout>

The `L1StandardBridge` is responsible for transfering ETH and ERC20 tokens between L1 and
L2. In the case that an ERC20 token is native to L1, it will be escrowed within this
contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be burnt. Before Bedrock, ETH was
stored within this contract. After Bedrock, ETH is instead stored inside the
OptimismPortal contract.

### [L2OutputOracle](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol)

The `L2OutputOracle` contains an array of L2 state outputs, where each output is a
commitment to the state of the L2 chain. Other contracts like the `OptimismPortal` use
these outputs to verify information about the state of L2.

### [OptimismPortal](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal.sol)

The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1
and L2. Messages sent directly to the `OptimismPortal` have no form of replayability.
Users are encouraged to use the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` for a higher-level interface.

### [ProtocolVersions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ProtocolVersions.sol)

The `ProtocolVersions` contract is used to manage superchain protocol version information.

### [ResourceMetering](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ResourceMetering.sol)

`ResourceMetering` implements an EIP-1559 style resource metering system where pricing
updates automatically based on current demand.

### [SuperchainConfig](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SuperchainConfig.sol)

The `SuperchainConfig` contract is used to manage configuration of global superchain values.

### [SystemConfig](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SystemConfig.sol)

The `SystemConfig` contract is used to manage configuration of an OP Stack network.
All configuration is stored on L1 and picked up by L2 as part of the derviation of
the L2 chain.

## L2 contracts (predeploys)

### [BaseFeeVault](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/BaseFeeVault.sol)

The `BaseFeeVault` accumulates the base fee that is paid by transactions.

### [GasPriceOracle](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/GasPriceOracle.sol)

This contract maintains the variables responsible for computing the L1 portion of the
total fee charged on L2. Before Bedrock, this contract held variables in state that were
read during the state transition function to compute the L1 portion of the transaction
fee. After Bedrock, this contract now simply proxies the L1Block contract, which has
the values used to compute the L1 portion of the fee in its state.

The contract exposes an API that is useful for knowing how large the L1 portion of the
transaction fee will be. The following events were deprecated with Bedrock:

*   event OverheadUpdated(uint256 overhead);
*   event ScalarUpdated(uint256 scalar);
*   event DecimalsUpdated(uint256 decimals);

### [L1Block](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L1Block.sol)

The `L1Block` predeploy gives users access to information about the last known L1 block.
Values within this contract are updated once per epoch (every L1 block) and can only be
set by the "depositor" account, a special system address. Depositor account transactions
are created by the protocol whenever we move to a new epoch.

### [L1FeeVault](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L1FeeVault.sol)

The `L1FeeVault` accumulates the L1 portion of the transaction fees.

### [L2CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol)

The `L2CrossDomainMessenger` is a high-level interface for message passing between L1 and
L2 on the L2 side. Users are generally encouraged to use this contract instead of lower
level message passing contracts.

### [L2ERC721Bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ERC721Bridge.sol)

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This
  bridge ONLY supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to
  wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT
  can be refunded on L2.
</Callout>

The `L2ERC721Bridge` is a contract which works together with the L1 ERC721 bridge to
make it possible to transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Optimism. This contract
acts as a minter for new tokens when it hears about deposits into the L1 ERC721 bridge.
This contract also acts as a burner for tokens being withdrawn.

### [L2StandardBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2StandardBridge.sol)

<Callout type="warning">
  This contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
  of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
  not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
</Callout>

The `L2StandardBridge` is responsible for transfering ETH and ERC20 tokens between L1 and
L2. In the case that an ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be escrowed within this
contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L1, it will be burnt.

### [L2ToL1MessagePasser](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol)

<Callout>
  There is a legacy contract under this same name.
</Callout>

The `L2ToL1MessagePasser` is a dedicated contract where messages that are being sent from
L2 to L1 can be stored. The storage root of this contract is pulled up to the top level
of the L2 output to reduce the cost of proving the existence of sent messages.

### [SequencerFeeVault](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SequencerFeeVault.sol)

The SequencerFeeVault is the contract that holds any fees paid to the Sequencer during
transaction processing and block production.

## Legacy Contracts

Those are legacy contracts from the old version of the OP Stack. 

### [AddressManager](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/AddressManager.sol)

`AddressManager` is a legacy contract that was used in the old version of the 
Optimism system to manage a registry of string names to addresses. We now use 
a more standard proxy system instead, but this contract is still necessary for 
backwards compatibility with several older contracts.

### [DeployerWhitelist](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/DeployerWhitelist.sol)

`DeployerWhitelist` is a legacy contract that was originally used to act as a 
whitelist of addresses allowed to the Optimism network. The `DeployerWhitelist` 
has since been disabled, but the code is kept in state for the sake of full 
backwards compatibility. As of the Bedrock upgrade, the `DeployerWhitelist` is 
completely unused by the Optimism system and could, in theory, be removed entirely.

### [L1BlockNumber](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/L1BlockNumber.sol)

`L1BlockNumber` is a legacy contract that fills the roll of the `OVM_L1BlockNumber`
contract in the old version of the Optimism system. Only necessary for backwards 
compatibility. If you want to access the L1 block number going forward, you should 
use the `L1Block` contract instead.

### [L1ChugSplashProxy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/L1ChugSplashProxy.sol)

Basic ChugSplash proxy contract for L1. Very close to being a normal proxy but 
has added functions `setCode` and `setStorage` for changing the code or storage 
of the contract. Note for future developers: do NOT make anything in this 
contract 'public' unless you know what you're doing. Anything public can 
potentially have a function signature that conflicts with a signature attached 
to the implementation contract. Public functions SHOULD always have the 
`proxyCallIfNotOwner` modifier unless there's some *really* good reason not to 
have that modifier. And there almost certainly is not a good reason to not have 
that modifier. Beware!

### [LegacyERC20ETH](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/LegacyERC20ETH.sol)

`LegacyERC20ETH` is a legacy contract that held ETH balances before the Bedrock 
upgrade. All ETH balances held within this contract were migrated to the state 
trie as part of the Bedrock upgrade. Functions within this contract that mutate 
state were already disabled as part of the EVM equivalence upgrade.

### [LegacyMessagePasser](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/LegacyMessagePasser.sol)

The `LegacyMessagePasser` was the low-level mechanism used to send messages from 
L2 to L1 before the Bedrock upgrade. It is now deprecated in favor of the new 
`MessagePasser`.

### [LegacyMintableERC20](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/LegacyMintableERC20.sol)

The legacy implementation of the `OptimismMintableERC20`. This contract is 
deprecated and should no longer be used.

### [ResolvedDelegateProxy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol)

`ResolvedDelegateProxy` is a legacy proxy contract that makes use of the 
`AddressManager` to resolve the implementation address. We're maintaining 
this contract for backwards compatibility so we can manage all legacy 
proxies where necessary.


## Releases

The full smart contract release process is documented in the [monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism?tab=readme-ov-file#development-and-release-process).
All production releases are always tags, versioned as `<component-name>/v<semver>`
and contract releases you'll see them tagged as `op-contract/vX.X.X`.

<Callout type="warning">
  For contract releases, refer to the GitHub release notes for a given release,
  which will list the specific contracts being released—**not all contracts are
  considered production ready within a release**, and many are under active
  development. These release pages are linked below.

  Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.1.4`, indicate releases of all Go code
  only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
</Callout>

todo: why don't v1.1.0 and v1.2.0 have governance proposals? Is it because they're
just l1 singleton contracts?
todo: write short descriptions

### v1.0.0 - Bedrock

The bedrock protocol upgrade refactored to the protocol to minimize the amount 
of code in the OP Stack, pushed it as close as possible to Ethereum-Equivalence,
and most importantly making the stack modular. 

*   [Bedrock release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.0.0) ...
*   [Governance post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-upgrade-proposal-bedrock/5014)

### v1.1.0 - ProtocolVersions

The Protocol Version documents the progression of the total set of canonical 
OP Stack specifications. Components of the OP Stack implement the subset of 
their respective protocol component domain, up to a given Protocol Version 
of the OP Stack.

The Protocol Version is NOT a hardfork identifier, but rather indicates 
software-support for a well-defined set of features introduced in past and 
future hardforks, not the activation of said hardforks.

<Callout type="info">
  The Protocol Version only applies to the Protocol specifications with the 
  [Superchain Targets](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html#superchain-target) 
  specified within. This versioning is independent of the Semver versioning 
  used in OP Stack smart contracts, and the Semver-versioned reference software 
  of the OP-Stack.
</Callout>

*   [Governance post]()

### v1.2.0 - SuperchainConfig with Extended Pause Functionality

The SuperchainConfig contract is used to manage global configuration values for 
multiple OP Chains within a single Superchain network.

*   [SuperchainConfig and Extended Pause release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.2.0)
*   [Governance post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-4/7534)

### v1.3.0 - Multi-Chain Prep (MCP)

This protocol upgrade strengthens the security and upgradeability of the 
Superchain by enabling L1 contracts to be upgraded atomically across multiple 
chains in a single transaction. This upgrade also extends the `SystemConfig` 
to contain the addresses of the contracts in the network, allowing users to 
discover the system’s contract addresses programmatically. 

*   [MCP release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.3.0-rc.1)
*   [Governance post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-6-multi-chain-prep-mcp-l1/7677)
