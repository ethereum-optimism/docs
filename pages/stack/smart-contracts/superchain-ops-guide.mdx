# Upgrade using superchain-ops

This guide outlines the process for upgrading Optimism chains using the `superchain-ops` repository. It's intended primarily for chains that are part of the Superchain, those with the Foundation or Security Council as signers, and/or chains requiring a highly secure process.

For chains that don't require the enhanced security of superchain-ops or security council signing, you can instead use [op-deployer](/stack/smart-contracts/op-deployer-upgrade) to upgrade your chain.

For non-Optimism governed chains, you can use [op-deployer](/stack/smart-contracts/op-deployer-upgrade) and your own tooling to upgrade your chain.

`superchain-ops` is a highly secure service designed for Optimism chains. It provides a structured and security-focused approach to chain upgrades. The process involves creating tasks that use predefined templates to generate the necessary upgrade transactions.

## Who should use `superchain-ops`

`superchain-ops` is primarily intended for:

1.  **Chains in the Superchain**: For standard chains officially part of the Superchain, upgrades are typically handled through `superchain-ops`.

2.  **Chains with Foundation or Security Council as signers**: If your chain has the Foundation multi-sig or Security Council as signers, your upgrade tasks should go through `superchain-ops`.

3.  **Chains requiring a highly secure process**: For chains that prioritize security over automation, `superchain-ops` provides an intentionally manual workflow with thorough verification steps (e.g. EVM state diff inspection).

For chains that don't fall into these categories, you'll need to generate appropriate call data for upgrades through other means or develop your own upgrade process for non-OPCM upgrades.

## Understanding templates and tasks

`superchain-ops` uses two key concepts:

*   **Templates**: Define what the upgrade is and contain the code for specific upgrade paths (e.g., [`op-contracts/v1.8.0` to `op-contracts/v2.0.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/src/improvements/template/OPCMUpgradeV200.sol)). Templates are version-specific and live in the [/src/improvements/template](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/tree/main/src/improvements/template) directory.

*   **Tasks**: Use a template to define a specific upgrade transaction for a chain. Multiple tasks can use the same template. Tasks are organized by network (`eth` or `sep`) in the [/src/improvements/tasks](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/tree/main/src/improvements/tasks) directory.

## General upgrade process

The following process outlines how to upgrade a chain using `superchain-ops`, using the [`op-contracts/v1.8.0` to `op-contracts/v2.0.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/src/improvements/template/OPCMUpgradeV200.sol) upgrade as an example. This same pattern applies to other OPCM-based upgrades (like [`op-contracts/v2.0.0` to `op-contracts/v3.0.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/src/improvements/template/OPCMUpgradeV300.sol)).

### Step 1: Clone the `superchain-ops` repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops.git
cd superchain-ops/src/improvements
```

### Step 1a: One-time Install Dependencies Setup
Follow the 'Install Dependencies' instructions in the ['Quick Start'](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/README.md#quick-start) section of the `README.md` file.

### Step 2: Create a new task using the quick start

```bash
just new task
```

Follow the prompts to select the appropriate template (e.g., `OPCMUpgradeV200` for a `op-contracts/v1.8.0` to `op-contracts/v2.0.0` upgrade) and provide the necessary details.

This will create a new task directory containing a `config.toml` and `README` file. The config file will look like this:

```bash
l2chains = [] # e.g. [{name = "OP Mainnet", chainId = 10}]
templateName = "OPCMUpgradeV200"
```

### Step 3: Configure the task

You'll have to add additional properties to your `config.toml` file to fully configure your task. For example, when upgrading from `op-contracts/v1.8.0` to `op-contracts/v2.0.0`, you can look at a previous task for reference: [src/improvements/tasks/eth/002-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/src/improvements/tasks/eth/002-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml):

<Callout>
  This is an example task. You must figure out which values you'll need for your own specific task.
</Callout>

```bash
l2chains = [
    {name = "Unichain", chainId = 130}
]

templateName = "OPCMUpgradeV200"

[opcmUpgrades]
absolutePrestates = [
    {absolutePrestate = "0x039facea52b20c605c05efb0a33560a92de7074218998f75bcdf61e8989cb5d9", chainId = 130},
]

[addresses]
OPCM = "0x026b2F158255Beac46c1E7c6b8BbF29A4b6A7B76"
StandardValidatorV200 = "0xecabaeaa1d58261f1579232520c5b460ca58a164"
```

### Step 5: Simulate the task

Before executing the upgrade, simulate it to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
just --dotenv-path $(pwd)/.env simulate [child-safe-name-depth-1] [child-safe-name-depth-2]
# Both [child-safe-name-depth-1] and [child-safe-name-depth-2] are optional. You'll only need to specify
# [child-safe-name-depth-2] if it's a nested safe and [child-safe-name-depth-2] if it has multiple levels of nesting.
# Omit both arguments if it's a single safe.
```

This will run through the upgrade process without actually executing the transaction.
For more information on the simulate command, please reference the [README](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/README.md#quick-start). 

### Step 6: Execute or submit for review

For chains within the Superchain, submit a pull request to have your task reviewed. If your chain is not within the Superchain, execute the transaction yourself.
