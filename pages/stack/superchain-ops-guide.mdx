# Chain upgrade guide using superchain-ops

This guide outlines the process for upgrading Optimism chains using the `superchain-ops` repository. It's intended primarily for chains that are part of the Superchain, those with the Foundation or Security Council as signers, and/or chains requiring a highly secure and manual process.

`superchain-ops` is a highly secure service designed for Optimism chains. It provides a structured and security-focused approach to chain upgrades. The process involves creating tasks that use predefined templates to generate the necessary upgrade transactions.

## Who should use `superchain-ops`

`superchain-ops` is primarily intended for:

1.  **Chains in the Superchain**: For standard chains officially part of the Superchain, upgrades are typically handled through `superchain-ops`.

2.  **Chains with Foundation or Security Council as signers**: If your chain has the Foundation multi-sig or Security Council as signers, your upgrade tasks should go through `superchain-ops`.

3.  **Chains requiring a highly secure and manual process**: For chains that prioritize security over automation, `superchain-ops` provides an intentionally manual workflow with thorough verification steps.

For chains that don't fall into these categories, you'll need to generate appropriate call data for upgrades through other means or develop your own upgrade process for non-OPCM upgrades.

## Understanding templates and tasks

`superchain-ops` uses two key concepts:

*   **Templates**: Define what the upgrade is and contain the code for specific upgrade paths (e.g., 1.8 to 2.0). Templates are version-specific and live in the [/src/improvements/template](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/tree/main/src/improvements/template) directory.

*   **Tasks**: Chain-specific implementations of templates. Multiple tasks can use the same template for different chains. Tasks are organized by network (mainnet or testnet) in the [/src/improvements/tasks](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/tree/main/src/improvements/tasks) directory.

## General upgrade process

The following process outlines how to upgrade a chain using `superchain-ops`, using the 1.8 to 2.0 upgrade as an example. This same pattern applies to other OPCM-based upgrades (like 2.0 to 3.0).

### Step 1: Clone the `superchain-ops` repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops.git
cd superchain-ops
```

### Step 2: Create a new task using the quick start

```bash
cd src/improvements/
just new task
```

Follow the prompts to select the appropriate template (e.g., `opcm-upgrade-v200` for a 1.8 to 2.0 upgrade) and provide the necessary details.

This will create a new task directory containing a `config.toml` and `README` file. The config file will look like this:

```bash
l2chains = [] # e.g. [{name = "OP Mainnet", chainId = 10}]
templateName = "OPCMUpgradeV200"

```

### Step 3: Configure the task

Look through other tasks in the directory to find the information necessary for your upgrade. For example, when upgrading from 1.8 to 2.0, you can look at the [src/improvements/tasks/eth/002-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/src/improvements/tasks/eth/002-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml) file to see that your config file should look like the following:

<Callout>
  Ensure you replace all addresses and other values in the example below
</Callout>

```bash
l2chains = [
    {name = "Unichain", chainId = 130}
]

templateName = "OPCMUpgradeV200"

[opcmUpgrades]
absolutePrestates = [
    {absolutePrestate = "0x039facea52b20c605c05efb0a33560a92de7074218998f75bcdf61e8989cb5d9", chainId = 130},
]

[addresses]
OPCM = "0x026b2F158255Beac46c1E7c6b8BbF29A4b6A7B76"
# Deployed March 27, 2025: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x902ce895f70a72110d40c9a734a26380b2e27c370aae90721cdfa1ac972cfff8 
StandardValidatorV200 = "0xecabaeaa1d58261f1579232520c5b460ca58a164"
ChildSafe1 = "0xb0c4C487C5cf6d67807Bc2008c66fa7e2cE744EC"
ChildSafe2 = "0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92"
ChildSafe3 = "0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03"
```

### Step 5: Simulate the task

Before executing the upgrade, simulate it to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
just clean && just install
```

```bash
# Nested 
SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER=1 just --dotenv-path $(pwd)/.env --justfile ../../../nested.just simulate <foundation|council|chain-governor|child-safe-1|child-safe-2|child-safe-3>
# Single 
SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER=1 just --dotenv-path $(pwd)/.env --justfile ../../../single.just simulate
```

This will run through the upgrade process without actually executing the transactions.

### Step 6: Execute or submit for review

For chains within the Superchain, submit a pull request to have your task reviewed. If your chain is not within the Superchain, execute the transaction yourself.

## Using op-deployer to create calldata

The `upgrade` command in op-deployer allows you to upgrade a chain from one version to another. It consists of several subcommands, one for each upgrade version. Think of it like a database migration: each upgrade command upgrades a chain from exactly one previous version to the next. A chain that is several versions behind can be upgrade to the latest version by running multiple upgrade commands in sequence.
