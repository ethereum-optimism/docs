# Privileged Roles in OP Stack Chains

OP Stack chains follow a [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://blog.oplabs.co/decentralization-roadmap/).
In their current state, OP Stack chains still include some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability to carry out specific actions.
Read this page to understand these roles, why they exist, and what risks they pose.

## L1 Proxy Admin

The L1 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Stack chains system contracts.

### Risks

*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

### Mitigations

*   L1 Proxy Admin owner is a 2-of-2 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A#readProxyContract). One owner is an Optimism Foundation 5/7 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92#readProxyContract) and the other owner is the [Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03#readProxyContract).

### Addresses

*   **Ethereum**: [`0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A)
*   **Sepolia:** [`0x1Eb2fFc903729a0F03966B917003800b145F56E2`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1Eb2fFc903729a0F03966B917003800b145F56E2)

## L2 Proxy Admin

The L2 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Stack chains system contracts on L2. The L2 Proxy Admin owner is the [aliased address](/stack/differences#address-aliasing) of the L1ProxyAdmin owner, which means the L2 ProxyAdmin Owner is equal to the L1 ProxyAdmin Owner, but due to aliasing it's a different address. Here's how that works:

*   Given an L1 contract address, the aliased L2 address is equal to `L1_contract_address` + `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`.
*   Using `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` as an example, the `0x6B` address is the L2 address that's been aliased, so to figure out the original L1 address you calculate `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` - `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`.
*   That result gives an L1 contract address of `0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A`, which should be the 2/2 Safe owned by Foundation + Security Council that is L1 ProxyAdmin Owner.
*   No one has the private key for `0x6B1BAE59D09fCcbdDB6C6cceb07B7279367C4E3b` on OP Stack chains, which means the only way for the L2 ProxyAdmin owner to send transactions is via deposit transactions from the L1 `0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A` address.
*   For help with the calculations, see the [`AddressAliasHelper` library](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/vendor/AddressAliasHelper.sol).

### Risks

*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
*   Compromised L2 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

### Mitigations

*   L2 Proxy Admin is controlled by the same L1 account as the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin). This is enabled by [address aliasing](/connect/resources/glossary#address-aliasing).

### Addresses

<Callout>
  These addresses are controlled by the same L1 Proxy Admin addresses. Please

## System Config Owner

The System Config Owner is an address that can be used to change the values within the [`SystemConfig`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/62c7f3b05a70027b30054d4c8974f44000606fb7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/SystemConfig.sol) contract on Ethereum.

*   System Config Owner may eventually be operated by a [Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885).
*   System Config Owner can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).

## Guardian

### Description

The Guardian is an address that can be used to pause several system contracts on OP Stack chains.
This is a backup safety mechanism that allows for a temporary halt, particularly of withdrawal logic, in the event of a security concern.
The Guardian can also manage various aspects of the `OptimismPortal` contract to address active security concerns.

### Capabilities

*   Pause several system contracts on OP Stack chains.
*   Disable the ability for specific dispute game types from being used to execute withdrawals.
*   Disable the ability for specific dispute game instances from being used to execute withdrawals.

### Risks

*   Compromised guardian could pause withdrawals indefinitely.

### Mitigations

*   Compromised guardian address can be replaced by the [L1 Proxy Admin](#l1-proxy-admin).
*   Withdrawals can be unpaused by replaced guardian address.

### Addresses

*   **Ethereum**: [`0x09f7150D8c019BeF34450d6920f6B3608ceFdAf2`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x09f7150D8c019BeF34450d6920f6B3608ceFdAf2)

### Risks

*   Compromised Mint Manager Owner could mint arbitrary amounts of OP tokens.
*   Compromised Mint Manager Owner could prevent OP tokens from being minted.

### Mitigations

*   Mint Manager Owner is a 3-of-5 [multisig](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2a82ae142b2e62cb7d10b55e323acb1cab663a26#readProxyContract).
