## Access to Pre-Regenesis History

Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).
However, you **can** access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using a number of different tools. For detailed instructions, see [Regenesis History](regenesis-history) tutorial.
