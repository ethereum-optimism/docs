# Network Faucets 

In order to deploy a smart contract to a test network like OP Sepolia you will need some testnet Ether (ETH).

You can get testnet ETH to pay for testnet transactions from a faucet. Faucets are developer tools to get free testnet ETH in order to test and troubleshoot your decentralized application or protocol before going live on mainnet.

<Callout type="info">
Tokens on testnet networks like OP Sepolia have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.

## Superchain Faucet
[Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) is a developer tool hosted by OP Labs that allows developers to get free testnet ETH to test apps on testnet OP Chains like Base Sepolia, OP Sepolia, PGN Sepolia, Zora Sepolia, and other OP Chains in the Superchain. 

## Additional Faucets
A list of additional faucets is below:

| [Coinbase Faucet](https://coinbase.com/faucets/optimism-goerli-faucet) | Get test ETH on OP Goerli directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or Coinbase Faucet. | OP Goerli  |
| [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/) | Another easy way to acquire some testnet ETH for OP Goerli and OP Sepolia. | OP Goerli, OP Sepolia  |


## Bridge from Ethereum Testnet

Need another option? Alternatively, you can get testnet ETH from an [Ethereum Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and bridge the testnet ETH to/from OP Chain testnets using the L1StandardBridge. 

Once you have the testnet ETH on Ethereum Sepolia you can use https://www.superchain.tools/ if you need to bridge to multiple OP Chain testnets at once.
