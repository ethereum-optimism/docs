# The OP Stack Client SDK

The SDK is used when you write JavaScript or TypeScript code, either in the client or a Node.js server.
In most ways Optimism is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306).
However, there are [a few differences](/differences), which sometimes require decentralized applications to access Optimism-specific services.

## Optimism-Specific Services

-   [Gas costs](/transaction-fees/overview)
-   [Interlayer communication](/dapp-developers/bridging/basics)

For example, decentralized applications might need to estimate gas costs.
The standard Ethereum tooling assumes that gas cost is proportional to the gas used by the transaction, which is correct on L1, but not on Optimism.
[Our gas costs](/transaction-fees/overview) are predominately the cost of writing the transaction to L1, which depends on the transaction size, not the amount of processing required.
This difference requires us to have separate methods to provide gas estimates.

## Access Optimism Services

There are three ways to access Optimism services:

1.  [Onchain contract calls](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/packages/contracts-bedrock).
    This is the way your contracts can get Optimism information or services directly.
2.  [The JavaScript SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io/). For use when you write JavaScript or TypeScript code, either in the client or a Node.js server.
3.  [Offchain, using RPC](/node-operators/json-rpc), which is more complicated but usable from any development stack (Python, Rust, etc.).

## SDK Chain Support

The SDK supports multiple OP Chains, such as OP, Base, etc.
To see whether a specific OP Chain is supported directly, [see the documentation](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/l2chainid).
Chains that aren't officially supported just take a few extra steps.
Get the L1 contract addresses, and [provide them to the SDK](/chain-operators/sdk#getting-contract-addresses).
Once you do that, you can use the SDK normally.

## Improve the SDK

If you find a bug, or if there's a feature you think we should add, there are several ways to inform us.

-   Ask a question in our [developer support forum](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).
-   Submit an issue on [our Github](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues).
