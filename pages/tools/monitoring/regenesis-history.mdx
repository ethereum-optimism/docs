# Accessing Pre-Regenesis History

This tutorial explains how to access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using the Etherscan CSV exporting tool.
Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).

## Etherscan access

<Steps>
### Step 1: Browse to the [Optimism Explorer](https://explorer.optimism.io/exportDataMain).
### Step 2: Select your address and the type of report you want.

</Steps>

## Dune access
If none of the Etherscan CSV files contains the information you need, you can use a query on [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz), similar to [this query](https://dune.xyz/queries/354886?addr=%5Cx25E1c58040f27ECF20BBd4ca83a09290326896B3).
You have to log on with a Dune account, but their free tier is sufficient.
<Steps>
### Step 1: Browse to the Optimism transactions on [Dune](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/OVM1.0-User-Address-Transactions).

### Step 2: Run the query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM optimism.transactions
WHERE "from"='{{addr}}' or "to"='{{addr}}'
LIMIT 100
```

<Callout type="info">
- Make sure to select the data source **Optimism (OVM 1.0)**
- This is how you specify parameters in Dune, `{{` followed by the parameter name and then `}}`. 
- Addresses are specified as `\x<hex address>` rather than `0x<hex address>`.  
- The limit is not required, but here to save resources
</Callout>
</Steps>


### Pre 23 June 2021 History

Follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Clone go-ethereum (the standard version) and checkout version v1.9.10

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git
   cd go-ethereum
   git checkout v1.9.10
   ```

### Step 2: Download the following three datadir folders
   - [Generation #1 (Jan to April)](https://storage.googleapis.com/sequencer-datadirs/datadir-gen1.zip) 
   - [Generation #2 (April to May)](https://storage.googleapis.com/sequencer-datadirs/datadir-gen2.zip)
   - [Generation #3 (May to June)](https://storage.googleapis.com/sequencer-datadirs/datadir-gen3.zip)

### Step 3: Build and run the standard geth v1.9.10 with

   ```sh
   ./build/bin/geth --datadir ./path/to/datadir --rpc
   ```

   You can then use ERC20 events filters to get the events that you want for each address. Note that you will have to repeat this process for each datadir to get the full event history.
