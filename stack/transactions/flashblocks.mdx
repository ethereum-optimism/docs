Flashblocks is a block builder sidecar for OP Stack chains that delivers sub-second transaction confirmations - 250 ms on OP Mainnet, configurable down to 200 ms.

By streaming pre-confirmations, "signals" that arrive before the next block is finalized, Flashblocks make OP Stack chains up to 10x faster, unlocking seamless user experiences without compromising security guarantees.

Built for developers who need lightning fast UX, flashblocks are ideal for DeFi apps, payments, games, and real-time interactions where instant is the only answer.

*   **Payments**: Instant payment confirmations
*   **DeFi**: Swaps and positions that update immediately
*   **Marketplaces**: Fast, frictionless checkout flows
*   **Games**: Real-time actions with no waiting between moves

## How it works

By default, blocks are produced every 1–2 seconds.
Flashblocks break that window into smaller intervals so instead of waiting the full block time to execute all transactions, the execution client continuously creates and broadcasts a "flash" block every few hundred milliseconds.

Each flashblock includes all transactions processed so far, along with updated balances and contract states.
Apps can query this near-real-time state using RPC providers (Ankr, QuickNode, Alchemy, etc) and deliver the speed their users expect.

## Integrate Flashblocks

Integration is designed to be simple and low-friction. Most apps benefit with minimal code changes.

*   In production, point your app to a a Flashblocks‑aware RPC endpoint from your provider of choice. If your provider doesn't support flashblocks yet, let us know on Discord
    and we'll work with them to get it added.
*   Alternatively, you can run your own flashblocks-aware node using Base's [reth](https://github.com/base/node-reth) image.

### Supported RPC methods

Developers can access Flashblocks using the same familiar Ethereum JSON-RPC calls.
The difference is using the "pending" tag to query the pre-confirmed state instead of the last finalized block.

*   **`eth_getBlockByNumber`**: Use the `pending` tag to retrieve the latest flashblock snapshot.

      <summary>Sample response</summary>

      ```json
          {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "result": {
              "number": "0x1234",
              "hash": "0x...",
              "transactions": [...]
            }
          }
      ```
    </details>

*   **`eth_call`**: Use the `pending` tag to execute calls against the most recent pre-confirmed state.

    <details>
      <summary>Sample request</summary>

      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "eth_call",
        "params": [{"to": "0x...", "data": "0x..."}, "pending"],
        "id": 1
      }
      ```
    </details>

*   `eth_getBalance` / `eth_getTransactionCount`: Use the `pending` tag to fetch balances or transaction counts as they evolve within the block window.

    <details>
      <summary>Sample response for `eth_getBalance`</summary>

      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": "0x0234"
      }
      ```
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Sample response for `eth_getTransactionCount`</summary>

      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": "0x1b" // 27 transactions
      }
      ```
    </details>

    Other methods, like `eth_getTransactionReceipt` and `eth_getTransactionByHash`, return data from pre-confirmed transactions without requiring the `pending` tag.
    Consult the specs (insert link) for more details on each of these methods.

## Libraries

You will need a Flashblocks‑aware RPC endpoint to use the following libraries:

### Viem

```ts
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http, parseEther } from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { opSepolia } from 'viem/chains';
import { publicActionsL2, walletActionsL2 } from 'viem/op-stack';

const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`);

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: opSepolia,
  transport: http("https://sepolia.optimism.io"),
}).extend(walletActionsL2());

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: opSepolia,
  transport: http("https://sepolia.optimism.io"),
}).extend(publicActionsL2());

const submissionTime = new Date();
const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
  to: '0x...',
  value: parseEther('0.0001'),
});

// Wait for pre-confirmation
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
const confirmTime = new Date();
console.log('pre-confirmed in ms:', confirmTime.getTime() - submissionTime.getTime());
```

### Ethers

```ts
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Here, provider is a Flashblocks-enabled RPC provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://sepolia.optimism.io");
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string, provider);

const tx = { to: '0x...', value: ethers.parseEther('0.0001') };
const submission = new Date();

const sent = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx);

await sent.wait(0);
const confirmed = new Date();

// should represent the transaction (pre)confirmation faster than standard RPC
console.log('Pre-confirmed in ms:', confirmed.getTime() - submission.getTime()); 

// validates the transaction hash returned by the pre-confirmed transaction above
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(sent.hash);
console.log('Receipt validated in ms:', validated.getTime() - submission.getTime());
console.log('Transaction receipt:', receipt); 

```

## Flashblocks FAQ

### Block building and availability

<details>
  <summary>How often are Flashblocks produced?</summary>
  The flashblocks target interval is variable.
  OP Mainnet runs flashblocks at 250ms while Base and Unichain run them at 200ms.
  A 2-second block at 250 ms produces 9 flashblocks, indexed 0 to 8.
  The index-0 block contains deposit-only transactions, followed by 8 normal Flashblocks.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will the number of Flashblocks per block always be the maximum?</summary>
  Not always. Heavy execution in one interval may reduce time available for subsequent intervals. The FLASHBLOCKS\_TIME setting is a target, not a strict guarantee.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do large gas transactions get delayed?</summary>
  High gas transactions can be included in any flashblock with sufficient gas capacity. Placement is optimized by heuristics, but available gas decreases as transactions fill earlier flashblocks.
</details>

### High availability and safety

<details>
  <summary>What happens if the flashblocks builder fails?</summary>
  In a default/non-HA setup, the system falls back to regular block building while preserving pre-confirmations. In an HA setup, `op-conductor` seamlessly transfers leadership to a healthy sequencer without interruption.
  When leadership changes, streaming continues seamlessly from the new leader so downstream consumers always receive a continuous stream from a single stable endpoint.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is continuity handled in high availability setups with multiple sequencers?</summary>
  Only the current leader streams Flashblocks. On leader change, streaming continues from the new leader so downstream consumers see a continuous stream from a single stable endpoint. For details on high-availability sequencer setups, see the [op-conductor documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-conductor).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do flashblocks change the safety model of the chain?</summary>
  No. Each flashblock is validated by the same execution engine as normal blocks.
</details>

### Pre-confirmations and reorgs

<details>
  <summary>Can pre-confirmations be revoked?</summary>
  Rarely. If the sequencer reorgs, pre-confirmed state may change - but this carries no more risk than the reorg of normal blocks.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why can a pre-confirmed transaction later disappear?</summary>
  If the sequencer reorgs, pre-confirmed state can be replaced. This does not add risk beyond the pending state reorg risk that already exists.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Does Flashblocks change liveness or withdrawals?</summary>
  No. Protocol guarantees remain the same; Flashblocks only speed up transaction confirmation.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the structure of a pre-confirmation response?</summary>
  In pre-confirmation responses, `blockHash`, `stateRoot`, and `receiptsRoot` are the values that represent the cumulative state of all transactions included up to that point in the block. The blockNumber reflects the current pending block number.
  Each flashblock's view shows the complete state incorporating all transactions processed so far.
